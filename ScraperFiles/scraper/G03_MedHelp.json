    "title": "COVID-19: Evaluating the risk",
    "author": "/personal_pages/user/20906447",
    "content": "Both of the following statements are on the CDC website on pages updated within the past week and a half: 1: COVID-19 Cases are Extremely High. Avoid Events and Gatherings. COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are extremely high across the United States. To decrease your chance of getting and spreading COVID-19, CDC recommends that you do not gather with people who do not live with you at this time. Attending events and gatherings increases your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19. Stay home to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays.html) 2: Evidence suggests that many K-12 schools that have strictly implemented mitigation strategies have been able to safely open for in-person instruction and remain open. (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/operation-strategy.html) Well which is it? I don't understand why, given certain criteria and and mitigation strategies are satisfied, it is supposed be safe to send my younger child into a public classroom most of the day, every day, yet it is absolutely not safe to see my other child who just left home shortly before the pandemic, even rigorously using all the same mitigation strategies, and with community spread being equal. It just doesn't seem to add up. To better frame my question, first consider my family still at home: Either my wife or I (not both) buys groceries once a week, at the time we believe is the least busy hour of the week. We carefully select and always use PPE based on the best information available. My son is in virtual school, and I work from home, except for rare occasions where it is necessary to go to work to perform my job, and then I follow strict social distancing and all the recommended Covid PPE and safety guidelines. We do get curbside pickup or go through the drive through a couple times a week. Otherwise, we never leave the house except for walks where we will not even be likely to encounter other pedestrians, or for essential doctor visits, or oddball one-off situations, like when we had to have a tire repair. Unfortunately this is against a backdrop of COVID-19 not being taken seriously in the surrounding community, with many acting as though there were no pandemic. Of course our strategies do really minimize encountering such people, but we can't reduce it to zero. Now, I don't have a good feel as to whether we have reduced our risk 70%, 90%, 98%, or even to near zero compared to someone who does not take COVID-19 seriously. Do the experts have a good idea to what the risk would be to people with our lifestyle, or are we still at a point where there is still not enough research or information so that anyone really knows the answer to that question? If there is a good, evidence based estimate on how much the risk is reduced for a family like ours, what would that be? And what is really the risk seeing family members you do not live with, given masks, social distancing, and other guidelines are adhered to? My personal prediction would be that it is less risky than buying groceries, but I would trust evidence that can be defended much more than my gut, and it really bothers me that an organization which is supposed to represent the gold standard for dispensing evidence based guidance makes both of those statements above without offering compelling justification as to why they should both be true.",

            "content": "You are saying the CDC says to stay home from events and gatherings (notably, holiday gatherings) to reduce risk, yet also says schools that have \"strictly implemented mitigation strategies\" have been able to safely open and remain open, and you find this contradictory? I've seen a rundown of some of the strict mitigation strategies our school district is going to use. All kids get their temps taken on entry to the building, every day. The kids and teachers are masked all day. The staff sprays the desks between classes. They seat the kids spaced out more than 6 feet. And they are going to send the kids home for lunch every day, rather than have them eat together in a lunchroom. This doesn't remotely look like Thanksgiving at Uncle Bob and Aunt Jenna's house. Holiday gatherings involve an affectionate group who wants to be close to each other. There are hugs, laughter, loud talking and shouting, eating sitting next to each other, and drinking and the let-down of restraint. Schools have control over their population, if they want to not create superspreader events, they implement the controls. There are no such controls at Grandma's house at Christmas. It doesn't seem so hard to understand, to me. I don't think there are absolute answers to the kind of questions you're asking about the exposure and the odds, not only because there are questions about how people get exposed, but also, some people are more susceptible than others to the same exposure. (A family I know has five kids. Covid came, and the wife got it, and her newborn baby got it. Nobody else in the family got it. Figure that out when trying to put together a standard rule.) My husband and I are cautious about the virus, and don't do much that we used to do. (We order online and pick up our groceries at the store, for example -- the employees come out and load them in the back of our car.) My loving and gregarious extended family, I have no way to know what they've been doing lately, like who they've been greeting exuberantly and talking loudly with. (Maybe nobody and maybe their buddy next door, who happens to have just been exposed to Covid and doesn't know it.) So we're just really cautious and don't expose, and we wear our best-quality masks when out, and we in fact stay home a lot. I'm hoping that by the time our middle-schooler is back in school in person, we have our shots.",

            "content": "Part of the problem is the age of your kids, which you don't state. Very young children don't get covid in large numbers, though nobody knows why. Older kids do, and while most are asymptomatic or have very mild cases, they are the ones along with young adults who are spreading the virus to everyone else. Us older folks are mostly, at least in urban areas where most people live, and except in very Trump-loving states, staying as safe as we can because we are more susceptible not just to getting covid but getting it bad. Then there's the issue of underlying conditions. If you have them, you're never safe around others. Then of course some of us have much better immune systems than others. I go to the grocery store. I've been to dentists. I pick up take-out at restaurants, though I don't eat at them. I always wear a mask -- now. In the beginning, we were told not to, and I still did these things. But I seldom get very sick with anything, so I'm probably not at as much risk as someone who does get sick often. When I do get sick, it's usually mild. Now, I do have a ton of things wrong with me due to a medication that messed me up completely, so I have a lot of injuries and pain and other things but that's not the same thing as being susceptible to illness easily. As for school, it can be done. The problem is in the US we don't do it. Ever seen a video of a South Korean school? Every child behind plexiglass. No eating lunch together. No playing together. I don't believe their school ever completely closed. They spent the money to provide this and enough space for social distancing and masks were already commonly worn there so no mask resistance. The problem is the US or Brazil or England and other countries where for political reasons society isn't willing to cooperate or to provide the funding to redo the schools. But the problem is still that the kids can pass the virus to you even if it doesn't bother them a whole lot, and then there are the kids who have had a bad case and that is even more tragic than when a very old person gets it. At home, you can gather, but only outside and socially distanced. If you have a big enough yard you can do that. There are videos from Canada of families gathering but never getting close to one another. Stuff can be done but apparently not by Americans. You want to fix that, you have to fix our culture and our politics, and good luck with that. So it's not so simple. Just hold on a while longer and we'll get our shots, but only if enough Americans agree to get vaccinated and wear masks and still what is needed to rob the virus of hosts. Until then, everything will be of some risk, and yes, it can be managed, but it isn't being managed yet. If it hadn't gotten political, we'd all be better off and a whole lot of dead people wouldn't be dead. Peace.",

We can lose our smell from any illness that impacts this nerve (where we are highly congested), but with all my time on earth, I never suffered that until covid. Good old covid. It started to wear I kept thinking to myself \"can I smell alright?\" as it must have started and taken a couple of days to be fully gone. Once smell was gone, obviously taste was too. There are sensory nerves that send signals to the brain to detect smell. That gets interrupted from covid whether from inflammation or neurological involvement. Not having any smell is very odd.

I was convinced these senses wouldn’t return. I read up about ‘smell training’ and bought some essential oils to inhale twice a day - I used lemon, eucalyptus, lavender, clove. It took 2 months to even slightly regain these senses. A very depressing time! Even now, the smell and taste are not as powerful as they were, initial mouthfuls register but midway through a meal it depletes.

We should merely be asked to disclaim any personal scientific certification. I am not certified (nor certifiable lol.)

While Listerine advertises it kills germs, it doesn't ever say what germs, and it has gone round and round with the FDA about this. For awhile, they had to take this off the label and their advertising. Then it was back. There are a lot of germs in the world, and alcohol alone kills a lot of them. That's what hand sanitizer is, if it's the right kind of alcohol and at the right percentage. It's not Vodka, which doesn't work. So the fact anything kills some germs doesn't mean it kills anything that causes disease. It might in fact kill more beneficial germs than harmful ones. If you're relying on Listerine, good luck to you. I use natural mouthwash myself, which also will show if you look through a microscope that it kills bacteria. But it certainly won't kill anything as serious as the flu or covid. Of course it gets in the nasal passage, that's why the test swabs the nasal passage. That's a given. But once you've been exposed, if it gets deep in the nasal passage, you've got the disease. If it's only shallowly there, you probably won't get it or you won't get a bad case, though you still can pass it on to others. So the Listerine isn't getting to where it belongs unless you're using it against instructions and unsafely. It also has ingredients in it that are toxic, which is why I use a natural product. You haven't gotten the flu because your immune system has worked well or you haven't been exposed to it. I don't use Listerine and I haven't had the flu, either. What does that prove? A ton of things in this world are anti-bacterial to some extent or other. Few are anti-viral. You would do better to just use saltwater at the appropriate concentration for any purpose cleaning the nose gives you. It has no additives. As for the mask thing, nobody ever said masks wouldn't help. They said masks were in short supply and were more needed by physicians than by the rest of us. As the disease progressed and spread uncontrollably, the advice changed quickly, and we were all told to wear a mask, but to make our own so docs would still have all the masks that actually work really well. For the rest of us, our masks work some and social distancing is the rest of the picture. Masks alone without distancing has never been the advice. At this point, most people could obtain some kind of the best masks out there, but most of us are still using cloth masks so the docs won't run out. They can't social distance. Peace.",

                    "I was thinking about the same thing. Only recently (like in the last decade) have they realized and publicized that dental issues aren't just a nice-to-handle issue for the teeth's sake, and that sometimes the kind of bacteria in decayed teeth can be very dangerous to the whole body. They now tell pregnant women that tooth decay can impact the health of their developing baby, for example. When my dad got old, he had a couple of molars that were clearly rotten (his breath was awful) but his wife didn't push him to get them taken care of. He finally did have them pulled after probably five years of increasingly horrible breath. What began for him almost at that same time, was Alzheimer's. We always wondered if the dementia was caused (or increased) by those years with rotten teeth. With infection in your head right by the brain, how could there not be an impact?",

                    "Except, nothing dentists do is actually good for you nor do they get rid of infection.  The only procedure that might get rid of infection cleanly is an extraction, but even then, and quite often, while the tooth is gone, the infection isn't.  You just don't notice it much.  Root canals lock infection inside the tooth, as only the largest canals can be cleaned out, and even then, there is often lingering infection above the gum line.  Filling a cavity puts toxic substances in place of a toxic substance, and the least toxic filling materials don't last that long.  Dentists are mostly to free us from pain, and that's a big big thing, but they really don't necessarily free us of infection or toxicity up there.  Plus, as you age, the amount of radiation up there just goes up.  This isn't that unusual.  Surgeries seldom fix anything completely, either.  We all do the best we can, and some just do what pays well, and some don't keep up with current knowledge, but the luckiest folks are those who just have really good teeth.  I only know all this because I have really bad teeth, and so you learn.  I read a very interesting article by a dentist who pointed out way better than I can just how bad for you dentistry is, and yet it's still better than the alternative, which is living the life you do have in constant pain.  So I am wondering how useful the above data is, given that dental procedures don't usually find infection or fix it completely.  So while we may draw a correlation between those with obvious gum disease, that doesn't count all the rest of us who have some but don't know it because our dentists didn't find it.  Maybe the correlation is, therefore, much weaker than reported, which is what I expect.  But who knows?  Just to say, don't worry about it, folks, we really can't know.  Peace, all, and stay safe.",

But when someone is slowly slipping into Alzheimer's and you're also wondering why on earth his wife hasn't pressed him to take care of the smelly teeth, it's natural to at speculate that the one condition prompts or aggravates the other."

They shut down incoming people early and firmly (except Bhutanese coming home), and their contact tracing was exceptional. (Within 6 hours of learning someone had Covid, for example, they would be able to locate 300 people who had been in contact with the sick person. In the U.S., if you ever got that far at all, it sure wouldn't be the same day, and in most cases there wasn't even much of an attempt.) Bhutan evidently has a lot of social cohesion and relied on it, and also (not an insignificant aspect of their success) there is high trust of the government. The king was photographed in his mask early on, and pushed for a lot of the other steps they took. And, the population being largely Buddhist, there is a whole lot of attitude that we must do what we can for the good of our neighbor. (As you can see, we are not talking about the United States.) Bhutan is no an idyllic place -- they have a refugee crisis with people displaced originally from Nepal many years ago who were never granted full civil rights, and who have been recently (and forcibly) been pushed back from Bhutan to Nepal, and it's been pretty ugly. But this article is about Covid and why they have had only one death.

An interesting sidebar, though, is that the Russian Sputnik vaccine and AstraZeneca vaccine and some others may be using the cold virus, which is also a corona virus, as their foundation for vaccinating against covid. If these vaccines are doing that and they actually work, I wonder if we get vaccinated with those vaccines whether there will be any additional gain against colds. I suppose it's also possible that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines might help against colds because again, while they don't use the old technology of using viruses to inoculate against viruses but instead use RNA to tell us to make antibodies that maybe since they target the spike shape protein that it might again prove to have some benefit against all corona viruses.

Tests are also a bit misleading in their results, as it can be you just haven't built up enough viral load for the test to pick up yet. The more accurate test would be the PCR test, which does take longer to get results back, but even here, early tests miss a lot because the person hasn't gotten to the point yet where the test can be accurate. You can take either kind of test any time you want assuming in your area the test is available. Because your contact was masked and short, you're probably okay, but probably isn't definitely, and if you were doing exactly what health experts have been recommending since the beginning of this nightmare, you would be self-isolating for 14 days (now down to 10, I think, to assure more compliance) to see if symptoms arise and getting tested if possible.

Pfizer mainly supplied money. The know-how for both vaccines appears to have come from the US Gov't, DARPA and NIH, and as usually happens, scientists working on projects with the US gov't with taxpayer funding then leave and form their own companies and make tons of money if a product pans out and make tons of money if it doesn't, as they get to keep all that wonderful venture capital money and federal funding.

As for the booster, that might need some explaining, as my understanding is all the vaccines currently in production and development will have to be gotten every year or at best every other year -- we don't know yet how long the immunity lasts just as we don't know how long any immunity if there is any from having had the disease lasts.

But the scientist from La Jolla Immunology research, California. said that His research showed that we do produce short term immunity via antibodies, as well as long term immunity through T Cells. He thinks either through having had the disease (shorter term) or having the vaccine (longer term). But not enough time has passed yet to know how long.  I would say 6 months to a year. But we don't know if its longer or not. We do have the FDA as a government agency to oversee the pharmaceutical companies. But yes it would be great to have a public health nationalized vaccine program. The CDC is our governmental program for advice. However, the way they did it this time did get funded by the U.S. and other governments, depending on the country, but the private industry used that money to make the vaccines. So really it was a lot faster than any government agency would be willing to do. So maybe competition in the market is good. Also, one thing to note is that he said that usually it takes longer because they get proof that it works (at least in the lab) so they can get funding. So the reason it was faster is because they got funded not knowing if it would work. So, the time isn't really faster to study people in clinical trials , they just cut the red tape this time and got funded later with risk of the vaccine not working. The usual 2 months was completed. That being said, they had already used the mRNA technology is trying to make a vaccine for the H1N1 flu. So they figured it would work since they already tried it in animals etc.",

There is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you, even if you are not at increased risk of severe complications. If you get sick, you also may spread the disease to friends, family, and others around you while you are sick. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an antibody response without having to experience sickness.\" https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/health/covid-vaccine-mask.html \"The new Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna seem to be remarkably good at preventing serious illness. But it’s unclear how well they will curb the spread of the coronavirus. That’s because the Pfizer and Moderna trials tracked only how many vaccinated people became sick with Covid-19. That leaves open the possibility that some vaccinated people get infected without developing symptoms, and could then silently transmit the virus — especially if they come in close contact with others or stop wearing masks. If vaccinated people are silent spreaders of the virus, they may keep it circulating in their communities, putting unvaccinated people at risk.\" As always, you are welcome to have discussions on this site, but you must keep it civil.

We both live together, and we've been sleeping in the same bed, share food, kiss, intimacy, yet my results came back negative. Going back couple weeks (nov 3rd thru the 5th), I think i caught the cold from my gf. She started having runny nose and coughs. I caught the cold from her around the 4th i think, started getting coughs, runny nose and mild sore throat. It hit the hardest for me on the 5th. Had terrible cough (phlegm), bad headache, but next day it was better, and on Sunday i fully recovered. My gf had gone to a state where there was many known covid cases. She went from 6th, came back on 9th. Then started feeling COVID symptoms on the 11th. She had fatigue, loss and taste and smell, and mild coughs. She tested postive for COVID on Nov 18th. Nov 19th is when i started feeling something, mild body aches, then the 21th, i had sore throat, and a headache - That same day, i went to get tested with my gf testing again, but I came back NEGATIVE, while she retained her POSITIVE. Today, I seem fine, my sore throat is still there, but i can feel it getting better. But im curious as to why I got a negative? Do i have low viral load? I take multivitamins, which includes D and i also take Zinc 50mg daily. My gf is better now, she has a senses back completely as of today. We are going to get tested again tomorrow.

Science does know that not everyone exposed to Covid gets it, they don't know why that is, yet. In your shoes, I'd wait out the time period since she got sick (I think most say two weeks) and if you still aren't showing symptoms, consider yourself either lucky (this time) or simply not prone to getting it.",

In other words, just because you had a virus doesn't mean it was \"the\" virus, and even if it was, it doesn't mean you tested in the right time frame for it to be caught by the test. You can get tested again, I assume, since you live with someone who has a positive diagnosis, and also you could get tested later to see if you have antibodies to Covid-19, which would also suggest that's what you had."

Most of the tests used show false negatives. Quick tests are the least reliable. The most reliable, the PCR tests, still have some companies that make unreliable tests. The cause of the latter is that in the early times of the pandemic the FDA approved pretty much everything that came before it, and a lot of those tests didn't work. The quick tests aren't a complete test and are often wrong. Some are wrong quite a bit. They also don't test for the same things, which partly explains it. So while it might indeed have been too soon to show that you are positive, or it might be your immune system was able to protect you -- clearly not everyone has the virus, right? -- it might also have been that your original test was just wrong. It happens a lot. I heard an interview with an ER doc and he said that at his hospital they didn't trust results until they had done 4 tests. So you might very well be positive. Of course, we don't know how you reacted -- at first sign of symptoms, your girlfriend should have quarantined, but we don't all do that and we don't all know it's covid. People do still get colds and flu and allergy problems and other illnesses. I hope you're both isolating from others no matter what the test shows to protect them. Peace.",

Not to mention, people from everywhere are in an airport.

                    "Also, still don't understand why the emphasis you're putting on vaccines not preventing infection but preventing symptoms.  The point of a vaccine is to prevent illness.  If enough people get vaccinated, the virus can't replicate enough and it goes away.  Might not be gone everywhere but ceases to be a problem as long as people get vaccinated.  See measles, polio. smallpox, etc.  The key is to get enough people vaccinated, and that was easier before than it will be now, as now we have this anti-vax movement and also Muslim terrorist groups killing people in Asia and Africa who are giving vaccines, claiming the purpose is to sterilize Muslims.  That's a problem we didn't have before.  Peace again.",

The 5-10% or so who get no symptom relief from the vaccine along with the unvaccinated population would be at higher risk of contracting the virus if the 2 vax create more asymptomatic spreaders.

What it is doing is trying very hard to get emergency use approval the world over so it can make as much money as possible, but it can only make so much vaccine.

One of the problems with saliva-based tests, for example, is that it's a lot of saliva to wade through to seek out virus molecules. (And as a result, those tests are often not accurate.) We can and do sneeze and cough out the molecules, that's why 280,000 people so far have died. But it's more practical to capture the virus molecules where there are the most but still reachable.

The thing to be worried about is getting the virus into your nose, throat, or eyes. The hands can move the virus to those places. The virus isn't dangerous to the skin on your hands, but to your respiratory system. If you touched something someone with Covid-19 had just that moment coughed on, and then absent-mindedly rubbed your eye or scratched your upper lip or wiped your nose, you could have passed live virus to a place on your body where you could breathe it in. But you would be more in danger if you were exposed to direct respiratory threats, like singing loudly in a choir and taking deep breaths between lines of the song, cheering at a crowded rally or football game, or sitting inside a restaurant with a lot of people who were all talking and laughing, and the restaurant had only one a/c unit that used recirculated air. It's good to be cautious. I keep a spray bottle of hand sanitizer in my car, and some of those little clear gloves that cafeteria ladies use to hand you rolls and buns. But I don't always put them on, even when dropping in to a restaurant to get takeout. I do always put on my mask. Try not to worry, it doesn't sound like you did yourself damage. Next time, just don't eat the chicken with your fingers. It's not sanitary for regular reasons (the hands pick up all kinds of bacteria) let alone safe nowadays.",

It is a bacteria that can be in the throat or respiratory tract in small numbers and it can be normal bacteria until someone gets run down due to a viral infection, fungal infection or other reasons.

I get you on the mask thing, but I don't think I look so closely, I just can't believe Americans are so self-centered that so many of them can't bear wearing one even if it means helping others. So that's where it has increased my depression, it is the revelation of how Americans really seem to be. It didn't turn out how I thought it would coming from where I came from and when I grew up. I would say, do you go out and exercise? Work in the yard? Are you able to do that? Because outdoors you can time your exercise to where you don't have to wear a mask and social distancing is easy, such as not going out until it's dark out or going to big parks where there's lots of space and it's pretty. It gives a little bit of normalcy to everything. But I don't think most people are happy right now. It's something we have to get through, not something we want to be doing. I don't have an answer for you or for me other than to suggest finding things to do that do feel kind of normal. As for your isolation, if I recall you recently freed yourself from a really bad relationship but you're now in covid and that makes it hard to find another. As Americans, we have had a pretty easy life in general for a long time now, but for many people life has never been easy and throughout history life has always been hard. At some point in all our lives, there will be very very hard times. This is one of them. It's no fun having to live through one of these periods, but they do eventually either go away or people get used to them and a new normal. Time is your ally. In the meantime, learn all you can from the internet, such as meditation or new forms of exercise and the like. This is easy to say, and it isn't how I'm living, but there was a time when I would have. Maybe you can as well. And know that medication seldom makes it all go away. At best it just makes it more tolerable for most of us. Some get tremendous results, but most of us don't, so we have to keep trying therapy to get over it. This is also something you can do online. Just keep telling yourself time tends to fix a lot of things if you can just get past the present. Peace.",

I do not live in a safe area and when I moved in, I didn't know this area but it is known as the worst crime street in my city. I am looking into finding better housing, filling out applications for subsidized housing. I am in therapy but it is online with my therapist who I had started seeing back in November last year. My doctor's appointments are by phone unless I really need to go in to see my GP. I wish medications would make all the depression go away, then that is not thinking realistically. I have 3 scheduled phone appointments a week with a Social worker who is working with me but he is not my social worker personally and he has been helping me try to sort things out in my mind and he gets me through my meltdowns. He is the best support I have ever had, but it seems I am always struggling with something. I know Covid is new to everyone around the world and the people who are living through it, well, this is the first world pandemic the majority of us have experienced and I know everyone is struggling through it.

They decided to take a saliva test, the one that gets mailed home then dropped off to a location. When they got their results, my mom detected but my dad not detected.

Heck they are so screwed up here in NJ with many urgent cares just doing covid tests. You make appointment, go at that time and wait in car, they call you and tell you to come to side door, swab you and tell you to wait in car for 20 mins for result, call you in 20 mins and tell you to come to door for the paper with results. So impersonal you feel like a leper. I even had a friend that waited outside for over 2 hours and they never called him so he left angry. Next morning he gets a call he was positive! Problem was he never got the test! I think with everyone trying to make money on this \"new\" disease with rapid tests there will be plenty of mistakes. If you want 100% true Covid test results get a PCR blood test. This will not only tell if Pos / Neg it will also show the viral load. Anyway to answer your question I would rely on your parents 2nd test and they are fine. If you never had Covid test yourself for the \"antibodies\", you may of had Covid and didn't even know it. The antibody test is a blood drawer and very accurate. If you test Pos for the antibodies you should be able to visit your parents without worrying about giving it to them. Also make sure they are taking 5000 IU's of D3 & Zinc everyday as a preventive measure. I believe D3 is the most important thing to prevent or after you get it to lessen the severity.

                    "I'm not sure a regular zinc supplement has any immune system effect, really.  Be careful about supplementing with zinc if you take multiple supplements, because it is toxic in large doses.  But the zinc that helps the immune system is either taken sublingually or injected, not just a normal mineral supplement.  And it's only to be used for short-term situations in those forms to prevent toxicity.  D3 at that dose can also be a problem, especially if you're out in the sun regularly and don't need to supplement.  1000 is probably the most that is safe to take every day unless a doc has said to take more for a short period of time.  What you might do when you're sick is a lot different than what you should do when you're trying to prevent getting sick.  As for testing, none of them are 100% accurate.  The most revealing interview I've seen was from an emergency room doc who said they test 4 times before they're sure, and that's with the most reliable PCR tests.  Sometimes it's too soon for the viral load to rise to a level that gets detected.  Sometimes the test is from a company that makes bad tests.  Sometimes stuff just happens.  The antibody tests are even more inaccurate, because the FDA in the beginning approved everything and a lot of them turned out to be completely bogus.  They did take another look but the cat was out of the bag and hard to reel all of them back in.  So you do need to test more than once if you had a contact that was a likely exposure.  The saliva tests are not very accurate.  Sometimes the inaccuracy isn't the test's fault, it's the way it's done or processed, but that doesn't matter to us.",

As I mentioned in a message you sent too many people will die before we get herd immunity. Thus getting a vaccine is important. There are several vaccines in the works. Two vaccines will come out at the end of year in the U.S. and I think in Canada, but only for front line workers and then those over 65 years old. That is ONLY, if the data looks good. Thus it has to give good enough immunity or \"efficacy\"  and doesn't harm people. This means the side effects can't cause symptoms that are bad.  These two front running vaccines are new technology. We don't know yet how long they will work (how long we will have immunity). Probably, in these new ones they will only have about 60% efficacy. So that means you will still get the disease if you don't wear a mask and but it probably won't kill you and they symptoms won't be as bad as if you got the disease. In addition, if these pass safety, we may have to get the vaccine every 6 months. So we will see. Does that answer your question? Later next year we will have other vaccines (hopefully).",

I'm not sure how you're going to wear a mask at home all the time, that's where you eat and wash etc. The proper answer is if you really thought you were exposed to covid you need to quarantine yourself for 14 days, not just wear a mask, as nobody wears a mask all the time at home. Now, if you have access to a quick results test that is an accurate test, you would know more. I gather you're probably fairly young, and the sad reality is that right now that's where most of the infection is circulating because young people are not following CDC recommendations, as your two car mates did not do. There is also no way to know if they have covid or not, as most younger people are asymptomatic but can still spread the disease. Now, would I personally do these things? I don't know. I'm not young, so I'm never in that kind of situation. I'm married and my wife is pretty much the only person I've been close to for any length of time since this thing started without wearing a mask. 15 minutes in a car isn't the longest or most intimate contact you can have with someone, so I don't know what the risk really is, but just going by the guidance, if you wanted to do what was the perfect thing to do, you would quarantine until you had a couple of negative tests, and most of us don't really have access to that kind of testing. For the most part, it's unlikely this will end up infecting anyone -- it's not like you were with them for a long time maskless. I think it's between you and your Mom. I also would say that, although California is the hardest hit state in the Union even if you lived in a state with very few cases you could not be sure because those states also don't test as much as California. We know a lot more about California than, say, South Dakota, which has few people but no restrictions on behavior and very little testing encouraged. So who would really know? This is the world in which we live right now. I'm guessing if I were in your shoes, I'd just go on with my life. Young people are a lot more active and social than older ones especially right now, so the risk is much more prevalent. But if I were king, I'd shut down the whole country and start over until the disease count was driven way down, and we didn't do that. Peace.",

I hope this makes sense. As for antibody tests they are much more inaccurate.  This depends on if the sample is collected at the time the person has developed antibodies.  It takes about a month to start developing long lasting types of antibodies (called IgG)   But they can collect a sample at two weeks and you might have developed the IgM (early) antibodies  .

I do this as I am an essential worker exposed to 100's each day and 1000's of people each week. Vitamin D 100 mg Vitamin C (1000 mg) use Emergen-C packets and mix. You could drink 3 a day for 3000 mg if sick or just 1000 mg for daily maintenance. Zinc (Sulfate, Gluconase, etc.) 50mg Tonic water with Quinine - You can do it several ways. Easiest and non alcoholic is take two glasses filled with 8oz of cranberry juice and Tonic Water . You are mixing up 50/50. That will get you 40mg of Quinine in your system. You could also drink Gin & Tonic. Make sure that you drink 16 oz of tonic water. I mix my Gin & Tonic with 2 oz of Gin then 4 or 5 oz of tonic water in a glass with ice. The Zinc and Quinine would hopefully kill anything that enters your system before it blows up into a full blow episode. The Vitamin D would stop RNA replication. Vitamin C helps your system regardless but if you are feeling sick, you could drink 3 - 5 glasses of the Emergen-C for around 3,000 to 5,000 mg of Vit C. Your body will process the Vit C and convert to Hydrogen Peroxide or something similar which will kill virus and bacteria. The Zev Zelenko combo to cure COVID is HCQ 200 mg 2x daily for 5 days Azithromycin 500 mg 1x daily for 5 days Zinc 220 mg 1x daily for 5 days. You notice the difference in the amounts for preventative and the cure version. I've seen variations of prophylactic measures by hospitals which are variations of what I listed.",

First was a dry hacking cough then two-three days after that she got shortness of breath which got worse the next day. She was admitted to the hospital.

One odd occurrence post covid is HAIR LOSS. No thank you. And many have trouble with fatigue and feeling winded for months after. Even if they had a very slight illness while diagnosed with covid.

Nobody quite understands it yet, and some of it sounds a bit psychological -- he's got depression all of a sudden. He's a body builder for years who is often still out of breath months after \"recovery.\" His wife also had it, and had a milder case, but she now has the hair loss. They think it has to do with inflammation of the blood vessels, which of course affects everything. When everyone focuses solely on death especially when talking about how benign it is for the young, they don't consider that a lot of people are having long-term problems. Whether it's permanent or not remains to be seen. But it makes the happy talk about how \"few\" die of it laughable.",

            "content": "I assume you're really angry with her from the way you are talking (\"high-risk Covid cases\", \"I got the info out of her\", \"ethical?\"), but it is a bit surprising. I assume you knew she was an anesthesiologist long before this. A lot of doctors who have died from Covid-19 have been anesthesiologists, because they are the ones called on to knock people out who need to be intubated, and the patients are coughing and gasping for air while it is happening. If she is your significant other, you must have known that with her specialty, she is always at risk. I don't know what you mean by a \"high-risk\" Covid case. Your s.o. could be exposed to a coughing, hacking person and not get sick, if her PPE was good enough, just the same as she (or you) could get ill from someone who doesn't even look sick. There isn't a strain of Covid that is higher risk than other strains of Covid, it's all the same risk and just depends on who the virus hits, how seriously it will take hold. If she had the agreement with you that she would tell you every time she came into contact with someone who had an extremely serious case, and she didn't tell you, possibly it's because she would be telling you all the time. I think that in order to do these high-risk jobs, the people doing them try to let the concerns of themselves getting the illness become background noise, or they would possibly get too panicked even to do their job. But that said, if you had an agreement that she would always tell you if a particular case was really serious, and if she knew the two cases were very serious and her PPE was unlikely to protect her, I'd say you have the right to be angry for your own sake. But if you are going to hurl accusations of ethical breach at her, I'd remind you that it would be unethical if she had not treated the patients, and that she behaved ethically to treat them. She sounds like an ethical doctor. Anyway, you're assuming she knew she was dealing with cases of particular significance in terms of her risk of getting sick, which I don't think you can know. And then, she got sick. She should have told you when it became clear to her that she really was sick with Covid-19 and not a cold or the flu. She has doubtless had so many opportunities to get sick, and had to wait through smaller things to be sure it wasn't Covid, that it does seem reasonable for her to only tell you when she knew she had it. If that is when she did tell you, it doesn't serve any purpose for you to be angry at her for not telling you earlier that she was exposed to two particularly sick people. Since you work with high-risk elderly and she is an anesthesiologist who by the very nature of her work will be exposed to Covid-19 probably every day, you need to decide if you want to be with her or not. And if you do, getting mad at her for getting ill with Covid-19 is not likely to enhance your life together, so think of some other way to make practical acommodations to the risks of her job. And please remember, Covid-19 is not easy to have, even if you survive it. She's sick. Don't yell at her and try to one-up her with stuff like saying she was unethical. That claim (involving outsiders) has no place in a disagreement between the two of you.",

He would have the right just because we had agreed. It would not be necessary for him to bring up questions of professional ethics, since me breaking my word to him was the issue. However, if we had not really talked about what we would do if one (or the other) suspected we had exposure but thought it could be something else, (or even simply, if one was sick with Covid but had lost the ability to be aware of it -- Covid is known for causing brain fog), it seems that the other partner doesn't really have much right to act like it is a broken agreement. You have to have an agreement before someone can break it. From what you are saying, it doesn't sound like your partner knew for sure she had Covid and hid it from you -- it sounds like she either wasn't sure or it just overtook her. If she was too exhausted to rinse her hair, she might have lost track by then of the obligation to communicate or even the ability to do it.That all said, however, it sounds like you are reacting as though the two of you had at least a tacit agreement she would tell you if she wondered if she had gotten Covid-19. It would be more surprising to me if a couple didn't tell each other such things (even as early as when it was just in the worry stage), than if one person did tell the other. I tell my husband every uninteresting detail about my health (as he does with me, too) from the moment of the first scratchy throat or stiff shoulder from sleeping funny. This is kind of a bellwether for communication between us -- he's always interested and would want to know. If your primary issue here is that you think this is a pretty dang big thing for her to have failed to mention (even if she thought it was probably nothing), I'd think so too. Communicating constantly (even about unimportant things) seems to me really significant in a relationship. Unless you are saying you would not marry her because you are upset with her about medical ethics, I would drop the ethics line of the argument, and instead talk with her (when she is better) about the communications side of things. She might not have confidence that you are interested in what she says even if it's humdrum; if so, it's time for reassurance and support. But if she is just not interested in having this level of communication, and if it is important to you (as it would be to me), you and she do sound like you have some talkin' to do.

            "content": "I will only tell you what the protocol was way way back in the way back machine when the virus was new to us. At that time, anyone in your SO's profession who was working with covid patients were self-isolating. In New York, when it was bad, they were living in hotels so they wouldn't infect anyone else. Now, we know more about the virus now, and the PPE problem is less but only in most places, not everywhere, so I assume she is using double face masks and a shield, as this is what is recommended and these things are now available everywhere but in rural areas, at least for the highest risk people like your SO. I mean, I just had my ears cleaned out and have had dental exams since covid and everyone who worked on me was wearing masks and shields there. As to any specs from manufacturers, I don't think you've got that part right -- there is no machinery or device I know of that was designed to treat covid patients. One of the reasons so many died in the beginning is that doctors were killing them by using ventilators too often. They didn't understand the disease yet, and ventilators are not made for covid lungs, they are made for lungs with different kinds of damage. They are too powerful for covid patients, so now they know to only use them if necessary and not to turn them up so high, but again, there is no ventilator designed for a covid patient. We don't even have any medication designed for a covid patient -- the ones they are using were designed for other diseases. So nobody can actually follow a manufacturer's guidelines and properly treat a covid patient; they are intentionally not following those so they don't kill covid patients, and the death rate has gone down considerably since they started doing that. I think the ethical thing to do involved both of you, and that was a sincere discussion as to how much risk both of you wanted to tolerate. You are both in high risk professions, actually, as you are both caregivers. You needed to decide a long time ago if you were going to live apart for the duration of the crisis or take the risk because you wanted to be together. If you didn't have that discussion, both of you are at fault, if we're talking ethics. But there's a second element. As soon as she felt symptoms, she had to quarantine until she either tested negative three times for a few days, or tested positive, in which case she had to quarantine as long as required until she was no longer contagious. I believe that time is some period of time after the more contagious symptoms are gone. Surely she knows that, and you should also know that because of what you do. The fact she did not do that put you and everyone else she came into contact with at a very high risk of infection, and there is no excuse for that at all.",

(But why would she think it, if they were \"non-emergent\"?) It seems like the core of the argument is what she knew and when she knew it. If she knew at the time that she was being exposed, she should have jumped on any early symptom and gotten tested immediately, while being careful not to expose anyone else. If she only guessed later that these cases might be where she got exposed, but didn't know at the time that they were ill, she had no obligation to quarantine until she showed symptoms. She has a high-risk job and works in a place where Covid cases go. If she was to have to quarantine every time someone in the room might have Covid, she would not be able to work. Yes, once she began to be symptomatic, she should have thought of Covid, and tested and taken precautions and stayed away from you. (Frankly, with your jobs you two should probably not be living near each other anyway.) I'll add, however, that if her primary symptom was being exhausted, that is so much the norm for doctors that it wouldn't be surprising if she didn't think it meant anything new. It would be easy to overlook that exhaustion might mean Covid if you live with exhaustion all the time. If she had other symptoms and didn't test, that is where you would have the beef with her, for your own sake. You are asking for help to \"understand if the behavior is acceptable to me in my chosen life partner.\" It sounds like you're saying \"the behavior\" is that she deliberately misled you.

                    "One thing that has made testing for the flu lots more common in the past decade than before (at least in my world, which includes a lot of elementary-age children), is that now there is something that can be done for flu. Last winter, something very unpleasant went around the grade school where I volunteer that had 25-kid classrooms with 9 kids out sick, and all the young moms were talking about having taken their child to the doctor and learning it was the flu. The reason they did it (instead of just assuming it was flu and staying home), is that Tamiflu is effective at shortening the time someone has the flu and making them feel a lot better fast, especially if the person is a child. I didn't know Tamiflu was that good: I remember when it was first developed, I think, and the stories were sort of meh because it doesn't *cure* the flu. But now I've heard story after story from the moms about how fast their kid felt better once taking it, and how they got well in like over a weekend. I don't prefer to go to the doctor when I'm sick, and of course Covid has changed the whole approach to going to the doctor when you might be contagious. (And some of those mommies probably had pretty fancy insurance to allow them that fast of access to a doctor!) But it's worth knowing that Tamiflu is out there. By all reports, unless one waits around to get tested until they've been sick for a few days, it does shorten the length of time that one is ill with flu (even adults), it evidently makes the sick person less contagious to others, and especially, it seems to make the person feel a lot better quickly.",
                    "My wife and I tend to have very different experiences when we get sick.  Now, we never have any idea what it is we have because we don't go to the doctor.  We've had illnesses so often by now as we're in our sixties that we know it will go away.  But I take stuff for it and she doesn't and my few illness experiences are much shorter than my wife's and much less intense.  At least, so far.  I take olive leaf and elderberry extract, and immune system stimulant, and suck on zinc lozenges when I get sick and as soon as I get sick.  Those first two herbs have some anti-viral properties.  My wife doesn't do that and won't do that, and so she tends to get sicker.  I'm sure Tamiflu works better and is stronger, but I do try to stay away from medication as much as possible because I've been on a lot of them for my anxiety over the years and so I try to minimize the number of toxic things I consume.  All meds are toxic in some way, so it's always a balancing act.  You make a good point about getting tested, but to do that you have to go to the doctor and I never have if what I feel are flu-like symptoms.  With covid around, that philosophy becomes a possible pathway to big problems, since the symptoms are so similar.  The outcomes are quite dissimilar.  I'm an old fogey, and we were raised to just wait stuff out.  Our parents never took us to the doctor for such things.  It wasn't done.  This is not really funny but in hindsight it is, the only time I ever even telephoned a doctor about flu symptoms was when I was in graduate school and I couldn't sleep and called asking if there was something that could help me stop feeling so lousy so I could sleep.  I had just had a physical, and when my doc got word I called he checked the results and they called me and told me to get to the hospital immediately.  It turned out I had a bleeding ulcer, or so they think, they never actually found it but assumed that's what it was because antacids stopped the problem.  So folks, sometimes calling a doc can save your life.  Peace."

We have a three year old and a six year old. If we’re going to leave the house, we need a babysitter. I am a middle school choir teacher and start teaching in person 4 days a week very soon. Even though I will be wearing a mask and my students will, I feel like this means my family poses a higher risk of infection to anyone we ask for help. Since we are most likely to have an evening appointment, that means the girls will need to be fed or put to bed. Social distancing is unlikely. I need to know that if a friend or family member is helping us out, we are not putting them at risk of infection, especially if the people who help are my 68 year old parents.

As an interested layperson, my comment would be that the science is not settled on any topic surrounding Covid-19, and that (perhaps except the way doctors mask and gown when they are in the ICU or emergency room), there hasn't been a \"best\" way identified and described to do PPE for people who will not be social distancing. Given that you are concerned about exposure because of your job as a choir teacher, it seems like you and your wife might want to reconsider having the appointment in person, and instead try a video conference. My husband and I recently had a legal appointment done that way, and though we were passing a lot of data back and forth and the meeting took over an hour, it was surprisingly seamless and not in any way awkward or clunky.

Once upon a time there was a separate part of this website that had medical professionals on it, but that's long gone. But here's my two cents worth: people are reporting good results at online counseling. The important face to face is you and your wife, not your and your therapist. I've been in therapy a lot for my anxiety problem over the years, and while getting out and going to an appointment can be helpful if you're anxious or depressed and avoiding a lot of things, it's not as important for actually getting better. That's a crapshoot and is probably more a result of how good the particular therapist is and how hard you and your wife work at it and want it to work. And I've got to say, if you're going to be teaching students in person, anyone who watches the news knows that middle school students aren't complying all that well. Your babysitter is much less likely to be a problem. As for PPE, any mask will do if it's thick enough and worn properly, so you need to test your babysitter by having them demonstrate to you they know how to wear it properly. Finding someone in a family you know is about the best you can do with any babysitter at any time. And your sitter will also have to agree to social distance as much as possible even if wearing a mask, just as your spit-spewing choir students will have to do, as that's about the highest risk activity going. I'm just saying, if you're willing to do that and can figure out how to have people singing around you and not infect you then you can definitely work out the babysitter logistics.

Speculation was that the steroids in the inhalers (which of course many asthma patients use) kept the lungs from getting the cytokine storms that are so deadly. If you use an inhaler, you might want to look up references to the study and see if the link has continued to be noticed (between inhaler use and seeming lack of problems with Covid). If you don't use an inhaler regularly but could, if it seems like the literature is still agreeing that this apparent safety provided by the inhalers occurs, you might talk to your doc and see if he or she would be willing to prescribe an inhaler. My son was prescribed a mild preventative inhaler that he was supposed to use daily, and then one for an emergency when short of breath.

I read that it can survive in the air for 3 hours, but in that experiment, i believe they were using fans to blow it and keep it in the air, but im not sure. Meanwhile other sources i read told me it only stays airborne for 14 minutes. Say for example, a girl named Marsha has coronavirus and her roommate, Jan, stays in her own bedroom. Marsha walks through the hallway and breaths in the hallway right outside of Jan's bedroom, then Marsha leaves and goes somewhere else. 2 hours later, Jan walks out of her bedroom and breaths the same air and walks though it, can Jan get coronavirus? Is something like that actually possible?",

But also that it takes more exposure than just one molecule of virus breathed in one time to reliably even get someone sick, and that the more exposure the more sick people get so the less exposure, the lighter case they might get. Also, it depends a lot on air flow in the apartment. If the windows are open a lot and the kitchen and bathroom fans vent to the outside, that is different than if the apartment is a tightly enclosed space that doesn't get outside air flow in any way. The research says that most people who have gotten Covid-19 were those with close, constant contact with someone who is sick. Though Jan would not be in much danger if the only contact she ever had with Marsha was from the one-time sharing of a hallway hours later, she might actually be at higher risk than in the scenario you described, because roommates don't just share one hallway once, two hours later. If you have a sick roommate, take strong precautions, keep the windows open, use the kitchen and bathroom fans to keep air flowing out, and get tested. (Also, I guess, hope you're in the 40% that they think might have some natural immunity due to earlier exposure to other coronaviruses.

                    "But on the flip side, I was reading an article about why US and Canada have different rates of transmission which stated that for the last 3 months most transmission in Canada has been spread by those under 40 who mainly don't view it as a serious potential health issue. 28 % of people surveyed in some provinces say they take no precautions including handwashing against Covid, so although those people might have to mask up in a store you can bet they don't whenever they can get away with it at a party. Southern hemisphere countries flu season is almost ended with very little cases this season and in South Africa there was 3 times as many people taking the flu vax this year as normal which is an indication they were concerned about disease and probably took care ot avoid it whenever possible,",
                    "however in the US there is a different culture among some (coronavirus parties where people try to be the first infected to win a prize comes to mind) so we will see how that works out in our upcoming flu season.",
                    "I think it will be regional as it is with covid, but the flu probably won't move about the country with the ease covid does because the flu never has.  Because we learned to just live with colds and the flu, none of us really did much to prevent getting it.  The reason is, for all you hear about people dying from the flu, the only people who did were very old sick people and the very young who, contrary to what you hear from the US gov't, don't yet have fully functioning immune systems and get sick all the time and are therefore likely to die as well from stuff.  For most people, the flu isn't much of a danger, so although it's quite a killer, it isn't for most of us.  On the other hand, when a particularly severe and new form of flu comes around, you get an epidemic or a pandemic, which is what happened in 1918 and to a lesser extent with swine flu.  Anything we haven't been exposed to for years and years and years we don't have the mechanism to fight as well (I would say, though, that 1918 was a very exception year and you never hear anyone talk about that.  We had our healthiest people getting it because they had been worn down by WWI and the economic toll it took on the world, so you can't really generalize from that one).  Canada has a completely different situation as a nation because they don't have the awful leadership the hardest hit countries have and so they drove the virus down.  If you do that, you can open up with less consequence, but Canada has a lot of parts of it that are just as wild as the US but they also have a lot fewer people.  It's a very large country with very few people, so a lot of space for everyone.  In the US, we have people who are ideologically determined to spread the virus because they support a political movement that believes there is no virus.  Unless that large group of people disappears, the US flu season might just be pretty normal unless we all get vaccinated and the vaccine makers guess right this year and it actually includes the strain that hits, which doesn't usually happen.  So don't expect flu to be subnormal and get the shot this year even if you usually don't, as I intend to do for the first time in my life.  We just can't count on Americans to do the right thing.  Peace.",
                    "Right after I posted, I read a CNN article that in Europe over 40s have lately been getting a much bigger % of the higher numbers because they are now taking more risks. I had assumed that people over 40 who are at risk are getting smarter and wary of this disease enough to protect themselves instead of doing things like going into restaurants for some mainly masked up meal sitting in range of strangers who can infect them (for some reason this experience is appealing to people) , etc. but such isn't happening per that article. So I've changed my mind and believe anything can happen in any country until everyone decides to stop rolling dice with their health.",
                    "In summary, I don't know what event (s?) will have to occur for people to be careful enough to stop the spread, but it's looking like the spread might have a chance to stop only with the advent of a Covid vax and/or rapid testing. This week one company has applied to the FDA with an extremely accurate test that they intend for businesses like stadiums where people can be tested onsite and each will receive a text within 5 minutes stating if they are negative. There are already somewhat relatively fast tests home tests approved that a CNN article last week said might stop the spread at a cost of $55B over a few months, which is nothing compared to the cost of the diseases not slowing down.",

                    "I meant there will always be people who don't care but if enough do care coupled with a techno fix the virus can be stamped out or at least cut to tiny numbers.",
                    "I think this is a case where leadership mattered, but leadership can apparently only stay firm on a virus for a short period of time whereas in wartime it seems much easier to get people to stay on course.  During WWII the American people didn't have the resistance to rationing, which was quite severe, or socialism, that it has with covid.  Perhaps we've just changed as a people, but whatever it is, Europe is indeed starting to have surges because of a lack of discipline.  But they are also reacting to that by instituting greater severity again, whereas the US seems to have given up and written off any0ne susceptible to the worst form of the virus.  So at least in the US, only a vaccine will save us now.  Even quick testing only works if there are consequences for not taking a test, requirements to take a test, a test that is not only accurate but repeatable over and over, and is used for everyone in the entire country, as the virus just moves from a place that tightens up to a place that hasn't and won't.  It's up to us now unless we get a change in gov't at both the state and nat'l level, and we can't count on that.  Peace.",
                    "And I say this partly because I live in a place that did pretty well with the virus, but as soon as it opened up there are young people everywhere congregating without masks and I'm seeing older and older people joining them.  The county where I live has started cracking down supposedly, but I don't see it when I go out.  I walk at night, and I see people returning from or heading to the area where the restaurants and bars are and they are all over on the weekends and none are wearing masks or distancing.  And I don't live in Trump country, far from it, and in that part of the country nobody ever really locked down.  I guess we are who we are, and we benefit from the strengths that gives us and are now seeing how bad the weaknesses are in the fires out west and with covid.  Peace again."

The FDA has been the graveyard for many promising technologies that spent years trying to get approvals and ran out of money giving competitors time for a better technology to appear. I watched a sterilizer approval take 5 YEARS that the analyst following it said it should have taken 2 WEEKS maximum since the company had done rigorous testing with their submission and some of the FDA questions that slowed the process down were repeats of previous ones that had been answered. The independent reviewers for the vax and the invigilators who conduct the human trials are not paid by the pharma company seeking the approval, and the FDA has to review the independent's recommendations - so Dr. Stephen Hahn would have to intervene and override this committee in front of the entire US media. Perhaps the administration will pressure him for vax approval ahead of time - but there are many people following this who won't take the vax if Fauci et al say it's not safe which is not a good vote getter, even if a gamble-approval works better than expected post approval because the election will be over before anyone knows the results of hundreds of millions of injections.

It uses a piece of the Adenovirus virus so you can't get the virus and it creates immunity because the body see's it as foreign. That is how all vaccines work.

I read yesterday that the MRNA vaccines by Moderna and Pfizer are going to have some trouble with mass vaccination . Mostly, maybe Pfizer if I recall correctly. As these two viruses need to Keep their respective vaccines frozen before use. The Moderna one is more like frozen part of our refrigerator Maybe -4 degrees Celsius as for the Pfizer I read it may need -90 degrees (this would require liquid nitrogen). The problem with having to use liquid nitrogen is that most out patient settings don't have the facilities to store liquid nitrogen. I think other vaccines freeze theirs at refrigerator(freezer) temp. The problem with the new vaccines (MRNA) type, is that this technology has never been used before. So there is some concern about long term side effects.

One of them has already proven to be not useful if it is covid and might make it worse. Get a different doctor.

The virus doesn't respect age and health. The good news is that if you do get it, being young and healthy does mean you have lower risk for complications. That's good news, but of course even if it would be mild for you, you still don't want to get it and accidentally spread it to people who are high risk for complications. One thing I've noticed is the panic over hand sanitizers. Plain soap and water are just as effective at protecting yourself and others. Also, avoid touching objects in public. If you use a public restroom, use a paper towel to open the door. Don't touch your face or mouth after touching something in public, before you wash your hands. Also, while you can't drive yourself crazy, sitting in solitude, social isolation helps prevent the spread of the virus. Don't go to places where a lot of people gather - that's all that means. Do what you can to avoid malls, concerts and other events, parties, etc. If you feel sick, definitely don't go out! Here's some really good information on minimizing your risk of getting the virus, or spreading it if you do get it: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public And just for fun, I found a page of myths.

But over 30 it is usually a cough, fever and sometimes shortness of breath. So nasal issues are associated with a cold or flu. Also, you can get a cough with the flu but usually not shortness of breath in the early symptoms. Another thing is Covid19 symptoms usually have a very high fever, 103 or higher. Although if you have a fever, cough and/or shortness of breath I would get tested. Not all Covid19 patients have shortness of breath so if one has the high fever and cough you probably can get tested based on that. I have also heard some people say they can get red in the face.

Like water, sodas, etc etc. Make a drink out of honey and lemon with warm water and have that twice a day. It tastes yummy and it is good for you. Have some orange juice as it is rich with vitman C. I take a glass out of fridge and let it sit in room temperature for a while and then I drink it.

It would be hard to generalize from anyone's stories (or all of them) what Covid-19 might do to someone who gets it. My cousin has Covid-19 right now, she's in her 20s. She doesn't know where she got it. A few days into the illness, she was too weak to get out of bed. Her headaches hurt so much that she couldn't sleep all night. She's less weak by now, but it is taking a long time to get better. That's how it hit her. But it might hit the next person a different way.",

Not many people actively post on this website, though I have no idea how many read the comments, but again, so far and so good none of us has reported getting it. We could of course all have it and not know it. I've had symptoms of it and thought of getting tested a couple of weeks ago, but tests in the US have largely been unavailable unless you meet stringent criteria or unless you're a medical worker. I went on the CDC website and it led me through a series of questions about what I was experiencing and ended by telling me they were sorry I wasn't feeling my best and hoped I felt better soon -- in short, I didn't have it and didn't need to get tested and with the still extreme shortage of tests even after all this time where most of us live we're nowhere close to what has been suggested by the experts, that to open our economy we all need to get tested repeatedly because the tests around today are quite inaccurate with a high degree of false negatives and due to the FDA allowing everyone and their cousin to sell antibody tests without FDA approval that they work those tests are even worse with a whole lot of false positives. Maybe before we're all dead we'll all be able to go and just request repeated testing if we want so we'll know just how many of us have it, have had it, and to make sure we don't get it an hour after we got our negative results, but it will be very expensive and time consuming to do that and we have a lot of people in the US so who knows. However, I've said this before, at a time like this folks used to tune in to their trusted TV and radio news programs and read the daily newspaper and all those sources are full of interviews with people who have had it and recovered from it. In real time, Chris Cuomo, an anchor on CNN, has been documenting his illness and slow recovery from covid. If you look, you actually can't avoid seeing this information, but I realize we live in a world today where most people don't read the best newspapers and don't watch or listen to the best news programs and so we're balkanized in what we see. The fact is, almost everyone who has gotten covid has recovered from it, but what recovery means is different for different people and is still unknown if some organs sustain long-term damage from it or heal. It's a new virus and it will take time to learn about it. But we will. Those who have died are high in absolute numbers but tiny in the percentage of people alive in the world. What we're all trying to do is make it stay that way until we have better tools to fight back. Peace, all.",

Also, some details about the treatment/supplements could be interesting, again, the TV/newspaper stories are tilted towards hardcore medications (remdesivir, kaletra, hydroxychloroquinone, etc.), the approved general attitude is to laugh at vitamin C, garlic, propolis, use of saunas, etc. I have googled stories myself, but most lack in the aspects just mentioned.

                    "You will never find researched information about natural medicine in the US.  This is historical and based on the economic competition model the US uses for everything including health care.  At the end of the 19th century, seeing a physician was still the most harmful thing you could usually do if you were sick.  Most people saw herbalists and homeopaths and the like.  Because of this, even into the 1970's American doctors were still less likely to tell you to take a drug for many things than to use tried and true gentler remedies.  If you had a cough, for example, they didn't give you an antibiotic whether or not they found any infection as they do now, they sent you to buy some cough syrup based on slippery elm bark and wild cherry bark with some alcohol.  It was only when things got serious they did serious medicine.  But the robber barons got together and decided allopathic medicine was where the money was to be made, and that's where their money went.  In the early 20th century, the FDA was created, and it was all about issuing patents granting lucrative patent approvals for synthetic drugs.  Those early drugs were usually made from plants they already knew worked, and they are still making drugs that mimic what plants do.  But they do it faster and in a much more intensive and isolated manner, so they have many more side effects but work much more quickly and probably more consistently.  There's a benefit and a big cost.  Because patent law didn't, until recently, and this is interesting, and theoretically still can't be applied to anything that isn't materially altered from a natural state, you can't patent Vitamin C or garlic.  You can patent methods of making them but that doesn't really give you much of a monopoly so there simply isn't the money out there to do extensive research on plant medicine or other natural medicine.  It's really expensive to do double blinded human trials, it takes years, and if you can't get a monopoly for a period of time at the end there's no pot of gold out there for you.  It is what it is.  That's our system, and it's why you might treat a large animal with minerals but doctors don't know how to do this with humans anymore.  It won't pay their bills and buy their second homes.  Again, this is our system.  The natural medicine system has been so demeaned publicly by these well-financed interests that it is now called \"alternative\" medicine even though it's the older form of medicine and the pharmaceutical form is so new it's actually an experiment on us as guinea pigs.  But when it comes to something that kills quickly like the corona virus -- it can turn on you in a second and go from a slow mild disease to something fierce -- it's unlikely natural remedies would be of help in time.  They are slow.  They are mild.  Now, as to saunas, don't know where you're going with that.  Putting someone with a fever in a sauna with breathing problems might probably kill them more quickly.  Garlic has no anti-viral properties.  It has some anti-fungal antibiotic properties, but not anti-viral.  Same with propolis, which is most often used with topical problems such as the gums or the skin.  Vitamin C has been researched a ton but didn't really pan out all that much other than what was already known, it's a powerful and necessary antioxidant that is great for long-term health but won't probably help you much if you've already gotten sick.  So this was long, but the lack of info is on purpose.  And with things that kill quickly, if natural medicine had been that great we'd have never looked for stronger stuff.  There is a place for both forms of medicine.  Eating well, exercising, and making sure you have all the nutrients the body needs to function optimally will enhance your immune system and help you avoid illness, but eventually we all die, so that means our immune systems do not protect us forever.  But it can keep you from getting this virus in the first place or, if you do, from it being at its most deadly.  But that's a lifetime commitment to health.  Peace.",
                    "Oops, left out the interesting thing I mentioned, which is that recently the FDA has granted \"drug\" approval to completely natural substances that haven't been altered in any way, allowing patents on them.  One is a fish oil supplement that is quite strong and uses a different method but is still just fish oil.  Another is CBD oil, which has been approved in very high doses for certain forms of epilepsy but is still just CBD oil, a naturally occurring substance.  I don't know how this happened or what it means for the future, but those are two cases I know of that happened fairly recently.",

                    "Troubador, here is a more recent article:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4103721/.  You cited a 1992 study that concluded that garlic had some anti-viral properties but only in vitro, not in real humans.  It has never, to my knowledge, been used as an anti-viral traditionally.  It has been used for all of recorded history as an anti-fungal and anti-bacterial in actual humans.  My own background is certainly not in medicine, but I managed health food stores for 18 years and never was a claim made by garlic supplement manufacturers that it was anti-viral.  If it is, it's not very strong.  As for your flu treatments, first, if you weren't tested for the flu, you don't actually know that's what you had.  We colloquially refer to lots of illnesses as the flu, but most of them are not in fact influenza.  Anyone can recover from an illness quickly.  We might associate things we do with that but we can't actually prove it.  You quote Linus Pauling. but all of his work on Vitamin C failed.  This is recognized by natural practitioners any by him before he died, but his legacy lives on.  He was obviously not a medical specialist.  But I will concede that vitamin C does help the immune system in that it is the most important and wide ranging antioxidant in our bodies.  But the amount you admit to taking can kill you.  It can tear holes in your digestive system.  I wouldn't encourage anyone else to try this.  A sauna might help you with minor illnesses.  I used to go out for a long hard run at the first sign of illness to burn out the toxins more quickly.  It worked when I was young enough to do that.  For me.  Not for anyone else necessarily.  I do take Vitamin C, but again, your quantities can be lethal.  It's an acid, and it can be hard on the stomach even in small amounts for some people.  It does come in buffered forms that temper its acidity, and that's why it is supposed to be taken with a meal.  But a sauna takes a lot out of you.  This virus, or true influenza for a weakened person, is pretty potent so I'm just a lot more cautious than you are in what I would recommend.  Someone with a fever is already burning up.  You are fine doing whatever you want, and if it works for you, and doesn't harm you, we're all fine with it.  I'm just a lot more cautious recommending extreme measures to others.  Chris Cuomo, by the way, did not have an easy time of it.  He's still not back to his usual self weeks after he got diagnosed.  He's an extremely fit bodybuilder known for his intense workouts, so he's also a lot stronger than most on here.  His family had a much milder time of it, thank God.  But he was in pretty dire straits there for a couple of days.  As for arguing covid isn't a flu, it's not an argument, it's a fact.  They are different viruses entirely, not in the same family.  Covid is in the same family as the common cold, SARS, MERS.  Not influenza.  Totally different things.  Now, I take olive leaf and elderberry, which are reputed to have some anti-viral effects, as well as zinc lozenges for the immune system at the first sign of an illness, but to my knowledge I haven't had covid and I've never been tested when I've been sick as to whether it was influenza or not.  I do recommend maintaining a strong immune system through diet.  I'm a user of supplements.  Just a lot more cautious than you are and skeptical equally of all forms of medicine for over-claiming.  Peace.",
                    "By the way, I\"m not saying don't take garlic if you want.  It's a great food.  But I'll also add, I never sold an anti-viral formulated by herbalists that relied on garlic.  Even in the study cited, they attack a herpes virus, and if you look, say, at a cold sore herpes formula it will usually rely on lysine and melissa (lemon balm).  If you look at formulas for chronic herpes, the main herb is usually St. Johns Wort.  I claim no expertise, just reporting what I was told by those who did have it.  But again, for all those out there, while huge quantities of Vitamin C might harm you, garlic in proper amounts is always fine as long as it's the right form to be useful, and I don't know what form that would be as it comes in many forms including just ingesting raw garlic and in that test tube study the authors could not conclude what in garlic made it work or how strongly it worked.",

                    "As one of those warning caution, Annie is where I am on this.  I do take a lot of supplements -- I spent 18 years in the health food biz and you can't help but get into them.  So just to say, I take a fairly high amount daily, about 1500mg.  I wasn't telling anyone not to take it.  I take it.  I take it in a combination that helps with allergies.  I also use zinc lozenges at the first sign of feeling something coming on, but only two a day as again zinc can be toxic in high dosages.  So just to make clear, Vitamin C is an essential antioxidant, probably the most essential, and as mentioned above it is water soluble so it doesn't stay in the system very long.  You can't finesse that by taking timed release, as they don't actually work most of the time -- when you evacuate it's sitting in the intestinal tract and it goes bye bye.  That's what they call expensive toilet water.  So you do have to take it more than once a day if you believe it is helpful and want it to stay in the body.  We were reacting to the humongous amount suggested by the one poster, not to Vitamin C in reasonable dosages.",
                    "And as to the protection of Vitamin E, you'll need more than C.  For one thing, tocopherols are only one part of Vitamin E.  Tocotrienols are perhaps more important, but aren't in most E supplements, but then, most of us don't need E supplements.  But C isn't fat soluble and E is. so you want fat soluble antioxidants as well so you get at all of the E.  One way to do that is to take lipoic acid, which is rare in that it protects both fat soluble and water soluble nutrients.  It protects Vitamin C from oxidizing.  But again, be careful folks.  Zinc is essential but toxic if you take too much.  For those who take multiple supplements, make sure there isn't B6 in all of them, for example, as it can cause a form of neuropathy and it's often in all kinds of formulas.  Same with Zinc.  Selenium is also toxic if you take too much, so you only need a little.  As for D, there was some research a few years ago that lowered the recommended dose from 1000 iu a day to 800.  So 2000 might be too much for a particular individual.  This has only become necessary as we've become indoor creatures.  When they told us to cover up when we go outside to protect us from skin cancer and to avoid the sun during peak hours they caused us to not get enough D, which is made by contact with sunshine.  So now we have to supplement.  Keveen is right, it all goes together, and it is very complicated, and there is nothing near consensus on what's appropriate, what's too much, what works and what doesn't.  We can fix this by putting as much effort into this as we do patent medicine, but there's not the profit to be made so the money isn't there.  Sad.  And if you look like Superman, it doesn't mean you are Superman.  Most who look like Superman take steroids, and they don't do so well health-wise and age very oddly.  Better to look like Olive Oyl and have no health problems.",
                    "The poster taking 1,000 mg of vitamin C every waking hour is me - careful, though, I was referring to the situation where I get the flu, and I don't do that for more than 2-3 of days, depending on how early I realize I have been infected - if it's very early, I stop after just a few doses (lasting half a day or so), and I'm fine afterwards. Normally, when I'm healthy, I take 5,000 mg per day (in one dose), and that's it. Please don't misinterpret what I said.",
                    "troubadour, yesterday I went back up to re-read the posts where you were talking about amounts and did see that you were talking about using that high of a dose only when you had the flu. I was going to post a clarification (even typed it), but couldn't figure out how to say \"The amount mentioned was not 1,000 an hour every single day; it's  'merely' 5,000 mg daily,\" because 5,000 is itself more than twice the recommended dose. If you're a Linus Pauling fan, I assume you don't think there are risks to taking megadoses, but that's a lot of vitamin C.",
                    "Troubador, we all have things we do when we get sick.  Maybe they work, and maybe it's just a coincidence.  Normally I wouldn't say anything about this, but because of covid and the warnings about its co-existence with flu next fall and winter, everyone needs to know that unless you get a test you have no idea if you have the flu or have had the flu.  Could be a cold, another corona virus.  Could be lots of different viruses or minor bacterial infections or sometimes even really bad allergy reactions.  When I was a kid, everything was \"a\" flu, as some these days are saying, but influenza now has to be looked at differently and more correctly by all of us.  If I got a stomach problem, it was the intestinal flu.  If I got certain symptoms it was the 24 hour flu.  Lots of flus.  But none of them was influenza, and we now must all recognize that unless you're in a hospital because you're very young or very old with lots of health problems, none of us have probably ever been tested to see if we had actual influenza.  I never have, and that's after 67 years on the planet and that covers a lot of bouts of illness when I was in school.  Given that I'm guessing all of us when we don't feel well just hunker down until we feel better again, get plenty of sleep, and do our anecdotal things we do in a kind of magical thinking without any actual proof it's doing anything because we don't double-blind test ourselves and don't bother with doctors or tests, will we now have to get tested every time we don't feel well?  As for that 5000mg of C a day, I would say, although I don't see any reason to take that much daily, if you do find it makes you feel safer to do so, taking it all at one time is self-defeating.  Your body can't assimilate that much, and given that Vitamin C makes people urinate more frequently anyway, most of it's gone into your toilet water.  If you truly want to have that much working for you take it in divided doses, some with each meal, and that way it will have a better possibility of being utilized.  As for Linus Pauling, remember, he had no expertise in health.  Clearly he was brilliant in his field, but health wasn't his field.  What he was trying to learn is if we can live forever by using antioxidants, and he settled on Vitamin C because when he started we knew a lot about it but didn't know about all the other antioxidants we now know are much more powerful.  His work proved nothing, which is still a positive contribution as it told us what didn't work.  Since then research has moved on to a variety of powerful antioxidants, and how different ones protect different parts of the body.  C isn't any longer the center of the antioxidant universe.  Science moves on.  Peace, all.",
                    "Paxiled, what other powerful antioxidants are you referring to, and what dosage is recommended? A reference would be appreciated, thank you.",
                    "I won't get into dosages, because the research isn't specific enough and there is no consensus, but anyone can either follow the recommendations on a label of a quality manufacturer or do one's own research.  An easy way to deal with this issue would also be to buy a good book on antioxidants.  That being said, here are some:  glutathione is the main antioxidant protecting both the eyes and the liver.  It isn't absorbed if you take it as a supplement, though it is available, but you can get it by using wheat grass regularly.  As the liver is so important, this one is very important to have.  The various carotenoids all have protective effects.  Everyone knows about beta carotene, which gives us the safe way to take Vitamin A without toxicity to the liver, but few know about all the others.  Any time you have a colored vegetable, the color is largely from carotenoids.  Two I'll mention are lycopene, in red foods, which protects the prostate, and lutein, in green foods, which protects the eyes.  Of course, they protect other things as well.  Lipoic acid protects Vitamin C and the liver from oxidation, as well as providing energy to our cells and cardiovascular system.  Pycnogenol from pine bark extract or the more generic proanthacyanadins from grape seeds may be the most powerful antioxidant we have, and works with Vitamin C.  So just a couple of examples, as I'm not the one to write this book.  Virtually every herb you've heard of that is helpful is helpful because of powerful antioxidants, such as berries, green and white tea, algae, turmeric, and, well, etc. etc.  Antioxidants are everywhere in plant food, most abundant in fruits and vegetables, not in animal food much.  Put them all together and theoretically we live forever, which is what Linus Pauling and others such as the Life Extension Institute were and are chasing, but haven't found of course.  Prevent cell death and they think we can all be immortal.",
                    "Meaning, I should add, there are a ton of them and I can't possibly put them all in here nor do I know all of them.  Most vitamins have some antioxidant activity, some a lot.  Many minerals have some antioxidant activity.  All plants have some antioxidant activity and some have a ton.  That's why they always say, a balanced diet high on veggies, moderate fruit intake (only because of the sugar intake), moderate animal protein mostly from the ocean, and there you have it, eat enough stuff and you get enough.  Want a lot more, take vitamin, mineral, and herbal supplements.  Peace, all.",
                    "And I never give references.  Or mostly never.  The reason is, which reference would I cite that is definitive?  Most medical issues have no consensus.  The fact \"mainstream\" medicine goes one way mostly doesn't mean that's accurate, it usually means pharmaceutical companies or textbooks written by doctors paid in part by pharmaceutical companies has a point of view that is what docs learn in school and is in their diagnostic manuals, but may or may not be the best medicine.  Looking backward, virtually everything we believed was true in medicine proved not to be or proved to be incomplete.  No reason to assume the future won't be the same.  That's because the body is very hard to understand.  Individuals differ a lot, as we're seeing with the covid virus in a way folks may not have been exposed to as much before.  And it's because medicine is a business, and as long as that's the case there's an incentive to overpromise and exaggerate and oversell.  We all do it in whatever it is we do for a living.  Doctors aren't different.  So you can Google and come up with a reference that has been gamed by those who know how to game Google, and unless you go a hundred pages into it that's what we see.  What is harder to find are the dissidents, and almost always it's some of the dissidents who prove to be right in the long run.  The same is true for natural medicine.  We have historical use, but much of what we take now doesn't have long histories of use because we use it differently now.  Take Vitamin C.  The ancients knew foods high in Vitamin C were good for you, but they didn't have the technology to isolate Vitamin C.  Because we can isolate things now using modern technology, what is known about it is brand new and therefore we can't say we know what the long-term benefits and detriments truly are.  The same is true for pharmaceutical and surgical medicine -- we've only been doing it for a very short time, and so we're still learning.  If I cite a reference or you cite a reference, anyone can come up with a contrary reference.  So it's best to do your own homework and make up your own mind unless there's consensus, and why I can list a ton of antioxidants, anyone who has any experience with food and supplements can do that, it's common knowledge these substances exist.  What isn't common knowledge is whether isolated supplements are necessary, work, are harmful, how much is best to take, etc.  We can only do the best we can with the information we have until as a species humans decide finding this stuff out is more important than other things we do.  So far that's not the case.  Peace again, and sorry for the long post but this stuff comes up all over this website and in our daily lives and it's important folks know we don't know what others tell us we know, we just have information and we all try to do the best we can and some try to harm us by spreading false information that makes them a lot of money.  So again, do your own homework and may it work out well for everyone.  Wow. too many words.  This stuff is what we used to argue about on the forums for natural medicine, but nobody contributes to them anymore, alas.",

At the time, I had no idea that was a symptom of covid-19, since it was only days later that it hit the news that loss of sense of smell or taste could be a better predictor of infection than fever. About a week later, I had a day of fever and headache, but that passed. My partner had only mild fatigue and some muscle soreness. His other girlfriend in NYC though had it extremely badly. She wound up with double pneumonia due to covid-19 and was coughing up blood. She did recover completely though. Other people I know in NYC have had lasting health effects. The office manager in my office in Maryland is still out with lingering effects since falling ill in March (I just donated a week of leave to her), and her fiancé died due to covid-19.

Chills with very low temperature, followed by high fever, very tight painful-to breathe chest, difficulty breathing, coughing, out of breath, loss of appetite, and weakness. But I never lost my sense of smell or taste. Those dramatic symptoms didn't last too long -about a week. I began to feel better quite quickly. Fortunately my cough was slightly productive, so I could get some relief from the tightness by coughing stuff out. What I coughed up was white, didn't look \"infected\" at all! So I felt so much better for a good three weeks, and slowly recouperating and getting a lot of strength back. But after that, the gut issues returned. Not too serious, just uncomfortable. My usual high-fiber healthy diet didn't suit me any more so I had to eat differently. That was more of a nuisance than anything. But it was not easy, as a strange anxiety also came with the gut problems. I don't normally get anxiety issues. So I'd had that since about May, and had learned to live with it. I was sure it was Covid, which hadn't gone away and I had the \"long tail\" version. But lately, I am beginning to feel a lot better gradually. Much stronger. The exhaustion has gone. I used to feel exhausted particularly in late mornings. I am now able to do more athletic things, and deal with heavy garden work like coppicing trees. I actually feel good while doing it! And okay after. I sleep well again now. I had some tests for the gut issues, and all the tests are negative. So that shows there is no inflammation or nfection there of any kind. My gut is much better. I can't tolerate as much fiber as before, but can eat healthy foods now. I just have to eat sensibly but feel as if things are almost completely back to my healthy self again. I honestly do feel I have recovered from Covid-19. I think it takes quite some time for the body to re-balance itself after this virus, and there is damagae done, which takes time to heal.",

However, these symptoms tend to flare up for both us on the same days and - in one case - down to almost the same time. Day 1: Three weeks ago my partner (who I live with) woke up with chills, full-body aching, and was having a hard time breathing - the latter of which lasted about 3 hours before improving. Concerned this was COVID and since she has a slightly compromised immune system, we went to the ER. She was ultimately cleared to go home and her tests came back negative. That same morning, I also woke up feeling terrible. I had full body aches and chills, as well as nausea, but had no breathing issues. Assuming it was something I ate and just coincidental timing with my partner's symptoms, I did not get tested for COVID. My partner had been showing some lighter symptoms w/out breathing issues a few days prior. I had shown no prior symptoms. Both my partner and I felt ill from around 6am until 2/3pm. The transition from feeling ill to feeling better was really quick. My partner went back to just mild symptoms and I was nearly 100% better. (We quarantined for 14 days out of an abundance of caution.) Day 2: Six days after day 1, we woke up with the exact same symptoms we had individually experienced on day 1: partner had trouble breathing, I had nausea, and we both had full body aches and chills. These symptoms lasted maybe 5-6 hours this time. Again, once they were over, they were over. We were back to feeling normal by that evening. Day 3: Just yesterday (just over 3 weeks since day 1 and about 2.5 weeks since day 2) we both started feeling ill again after a couple weeks of feeling fine. This time, our symptoms started at around 6:30pm and they lasted about 3 hours. The freaky part was that our symptoms flared up almost down to the minute and came on like a light switch. Within 20 minutes or so we both went from feeling fine to feeling chills, aches, nausea, and partner had tightness of chest again. We are both mid-twenties, generally healthy, get consistent exercise, etc. Outside of partner's immune system (IgA deficiency) we have no other underlying conditions. Between our symptom flare ups, we have felt generally well. Is this COVID and the test just came back false negative, or something else? And why we are experiencing symptoms at nearly the same times?",

Perhaps some of what one person feels is flaring up has been that way for a while but they don't notice it until the other person does. Anyway you both are sick with something that is not diagnosed. Perhaps you two were food poisoned (that wouldn't create difficulty breathing though) a few times or got flu at the same time or some combination of different maladies occurred? Without a diagnosis and test you cannot know what you were suffering from. It seems unlikely that Covid would hit you once a week 3 times and clear up within hours each time. Since only one person was tested and only once, you could consider getting looked at by a doctor and tested again if you feel ill then.",

    "content": "I live in a 55+ condo community. We had our association meeting last night. Ages 63-95. 5 people at table 1, not distanced, 1 with mask, 2 w/masks in hand, 2 without masks. 3 people at table 2, 1 distanced but no mask, 2 not distanced (married) but w/masks. I then sat at table 3, distanced, with mask. The first thing is that the two speakers (board members) at table 1 waved the masks in their hands (one of them has high volume public contact daily) and said they were not going to wear them unless anyone objected. Another board member with mask then removed her mask in generational conformity, leaving 5 without mask and not distanced at table 1. The woman without mask at table 2 has a hearing disability and then walked over to table 1 and spoke to two of the ladies ~6inches face to face to repeat loudly (droplets...) what was under discussion. I have been wearing masks when flu season starts, for many years. I will never forget Dr Fauci standing in front of America and saying \"Don't wear a mask.\" (I understand what he was trying to say don't wear MEDICAL-GRADE masks because healthcare providers need them. They need to read from proof-read scripts only, imo.) So the local farm supply store is selling pkgs of 5 K N95 masks for ~$20 and there were a hundred packages, 2 companies, made in China. Nice masks. Mom and I bought a package to share and the spares will come in handy this coming flu season. So is K N95 the same as N95??",

You can get cloth masks with filters and get basically the same protection, and they'll probably be more comfortable for regular use. That's what non-medical providers are supposed to be wearing - as in, all of us regular people. If you're familiar with Etsy, loads of people are selling them there. Just go to www.etsy.com and search masks if you don't know anyone who is making them. I'm shocked that a group of older people got together and masks weren't worn. I'm not a senior, but I do have some risk, and I wouldn't have stayed, or I would have insisted that masks be worn.",

Maybe farmers are considered so essential that they are in the same category.

            "content": "The N95 masks are US masks. They fit more tightly with a different strap system. Some think they're less comfortable but more protective by a small amount because they are sealed so tightly. KN95 masks are the Chinese version, and have earloops instead of straps and so are more comfortable but perhaps seal a tiny bit less. Both are certified by the FDA for use right now for medical professionals. Nobody else is actually allowed to have one, as they are in short supply. Assuming you actually got what you think you got, you got the Chinese version. There are other versions, for example Europe has their version as well. They all are rated to filter out 95% of particles. There is a version of respirator masks that have an \"out\" part as well as the \"incoming\" filter. You don't want those, as they are open to the outside. I'd be a bit suspicious if you got the real deal as was said above, as nobody's allowed to sell them to individuals right now. But for you it doesn't really matter. The purpose of wearing a mask is to protect others from you, not so much you from others, but if you actually have a respirator mask you will be more protected from others. As for the meeting, I would have walked out and demanded future meetings be held on Zoom if social distancing and mask wearing aren't going to be enforced. This problem has existed since before shut down orders. It was particularly egregious in Florida, where communities of older folks were pooh-poohing the whole thing. One community got in the news about it, and later suffered a large outbreak of virus. I will say one thing to Annie though, if we can't try to change people politically we need to end our democratic system of gov't. If we can't discuss and try to change one another's minds life will stay mired in the mud. Getting angry at someone isn't helpful, but we do have to progress and we only do that by convincing one another. In the case of the corona virus, in the US it is not able to be separated from politics, which is really unfortunate. While this is also true in Russia and Brazil and other countries with authoritarian or just bad gov't, it shouldn't be the case in the US. The fact that it has become that way needs to be discussed until we fix it, because right now we have a crisis that can kill us and we can't afford bad gov't. Just my thoughts, because so many seem to be terrified of one another right now and I don't get why, we didn't used to be this way. Peace, all.",

There aren't as many people around as there used to be, the air flow is appropriate, etc. You could call the hotel where you're going to find out what measures they take to sanitize the rooms.

Anyway, breathing out the virus could shed a few viruses into the air. This is not like sneezing or coughing in terms of how many, forcefully blown across the room, moist, or large the particles might be. The chance of getting sick and the level of illness a person gets is directly related to how much exposure they have had. You being in line in front of someone for a short time who wasn't coughing or sneezing is not much exposure. Some people won't wear a mask. Stores don't have bouncers who will throw people out for that reason. All you can do is either assume the risk and go about your (modified) life, or stay in all the time. If your city is close to entering the green phase, your risk is not like a place where the case numbers are rocketing up.

I know everything you see and hear is that breast milk is best. Your milk didn't come in. Sometimes it just doesn't.

The important thing about breast feeding is that it provides the initial immune system, something called colostrum among others, that can't be gotten from formula. So yes, it is important for the immune system. I'm 67 now and when I grew up almost nobody breast fed in developed countries as Nestles convinced doctors formula was better for them. It was a lie. But not breastfeeding is usually more of an annoyance than life or death. It can mean more chance of things like allergies and the like, but I mean, I am 67, I'm not dead. Almost everyone I ever knew is also still alive. There is no reason to beat yourself up over it, but there is good reason to make sure it's not something that can be fixed. Women used to take some simple herbs that helped, though we don't do that much anymore. I believe fennel is one of them. So talk to your docs and see if it's related to nutrition or worry or something like that. Women also used to use what were called wet nurses when they couldn't breastfeed, which is basically using the milk of another woman. I believe this still exists in many communities. There is an organization called, I think, Le Leche League or something like that to help with issues of pregnancy and breastfeeding. And if you can't, you can't. Now, the good news about covid is, babies don't seem to get it much. Nobody knows why, but it just hasn't been an issue with newborns. Maybe future info will change that, but I believe that's been the case so far. Relax and enjoy your new baby, and congratulations.",

                    "And you're wrong, wrong, wrong.  In a few months over 82,000 people have died of this monster in the US.  In the world, I think it's up to 250,000 dead, or near to that.  That's in a matter of months.  I have no idea how many people die of dementia, because people with dementia die of lots of things.  This is not a flu.  Older people with co-morbidity were more likely to die in the beginning, but we now know that young people are dying too.  Healthy people are suddenly dropping into severe illness and death.  Those people in the Nursing homes got it from their younger relatives and caregivers, who got it first.  Children can die of it.  Months after getting it you can still be sick.  Children are getting horrible shock symptoms despite having had very mild cases.  It's all well and good to talk in generalities, and you are probably right, we will have to get used to this if we don't get a vaccine and just watch the herd get culled.  We aren't going to hide at home forever, or even much longer, as people gotta eat.  But if you go by since November when the first cases were seen but not known yet as covid to now, look at those numbers.  Nothing kills that much.  In time, it might well become much less lethal in order to survive -- no virus can survive if it kills too many hosts -- but for right now, it is what it is and it is the most contagious and weird disease we've seen in our lifetimes.  There is no sense being paranoid about it, you're right, and again, I think you're right, we're just going to have to sacrifice a ton of people if there's no treatment or vaccine eventually, but for now, patience, let's see if we can't find those things before we just give up.  When you say the \"only\" people who have to fear it are old people with co-morbidities, that's just inaccurate.  And it's not just another flu, as if we want another flu.  Flu kills the very young and the very old.  This one can kill anyone, or if not, leave them very damaged for at least a time.  We can wait some more time to see if we can find a way to fight back.  But if we can't, then as I said, you're probably right, we'll just have to watch a million or two die of it until we get her immunity, assuming immunity is gotten -- we still don't know yet for certain if we do get immunity or how long it lasts if we do.",
                    "I have friends with health problems.  I have MANY friends who are over 60, including my own parents.  Casually mentioning that it's \"just those people\" dying suggests that their lives are less valuable than others, and is, quite frankly, demeaning to those of us who fall into the at-risk category or have loved ones who do.",

                    "And just to add, and not just because I'm 67 although I have none of the co-morbidity factors, remember, a lot of younger people do have those co-morbidity factors.  I'm not sure obesity is one of them, but particularly in the US we have a very sick population.  We eat poorly, live a very stressful life not because we need to but because we impose it on ourselves, and allow ourselves to wallow in a pollution-filled world of tainted air, water, and food.  And we eat things that aren't food at all.  That means a lot of younger folks are also at higher risk.  African Americans are suffering disproportionately because of our history.  It's just a bad situation all around that shouldn't have been this bad here.  But keep in mind that in every society it's the older folks who have the most money because they spent a lifetime earning it, while the young haven't accumulated wealth yet.  While that doesn't include me, it does mean if you want the economy to get going again you need people who have money to buy the stuff that lets the younger folks earn it."

            "content": "This article has info all in one place. It was already excerpted when I saw it; I assume that is what the elipses are. ________ (Excerpted from:) \"The Risks - Know Them - Avoid Them\" by Professor Erin Bromage, Comparative Immunologist and Professor of Biology (specializing in Immunology) at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. The main sources for infection are home, workplace, public transport, social gatherings, and restaurants. This accounts for 90% of all transmission events. The biggest outbreaks have been in enclosed environments with poor air circulation and high density of people. These have included prisons, religious ceremonies, group-living situations, and workplaces such as meat-packing facilities and call centers. I regularly hear people worrying about grocery stores, bike rides, inconsiderate runners who are not wearing masks ... are these places of concern? [ ] In order to get infected you need to get exposed to an infectious dose of the virus[.] ... [You can get infected by:] [Touching things in a b]athroom: Bathrooms have a lot of high-touch surfaces, door handles, faucets, stall doors. Transfer risk in this environment can be high. We ... do not know whether a person releases infectious material in feces or just fragmented virus, but we do know that toilet flushing aerosolizes many droplets. Treat public bathrooms with extra caution (surface and air), until more is known about the risk. A cough: A single cough releases about 3,000 droplets, and droplets travel at 50 miles per hour. Most droplets are large, and fall quickly, but many stay in the air and can travel across a room in a few seconds. A sneeze: A single sneeze releases about 30,000 droplets, with droplets traveling at up to 200 miles per hour. Most droplets are small and travel great distances (easily across a room). If a person is infected, the droplets in a single cough or sneeze may contain as many as 200,000,000 (two hundred million) virus particles, which can all be dispersed into the environment around them. A breath: A single breath releases 50 - 5000 droplets. Most of these droplets are low velocity, and fall to the ground quickly. There are even fewer droplets released through nose-breathing. Importantly, due to the lack of exhalation force with a breath, viral particles from the lower respiratory areas are not expelled. ... All you have to do is enter a room within a few minutes of a cough/sneeze and take a few breaths and you have potentially received enough virus to establish an infection. ... With general breathing of 20 copies [of the virus] per minute into the environment, even if every virus ended up in your lungs, you would need 1000 copies divided by 20 copies per minute: 50 minutes [of exposure]. Speaking increases the release of respiratory droplets about 10 fold; ~200 copies of virus per minute. Again, assuming every virus is inhaled, it would take ~5 minutes of speaking face-to-face to receive the required dose. Anyone you spend greater than 10 minutes with in a face-to-face situation is potentially infectious [or could get infected by you]. ... It appears approximately 40% of all infections -- and the majority of community-acquired transmissions -- have occurred from people without symptoms (asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people). You can be shedding the virus into the environment for up to 5 days before symptoms begin. ... Social-distancing rules are to protect you with brief exposures, or outdoor exposures. Social-distancing guidelines don't hold in indoor spaces where you spend a lot of time, as people on the opposite side of the room have gotten infected. If you are in an open-floorplan office ... critically assess the risk (volume, people, and airflow). If you are in a job that requires face-to-face talking or even worse, yelling, you should assess [whether the risk is worth it to you]. ... Even if gung-ho for resuming business as usual, do your part and wear a mask to reduce what you release into the environment. ... Infected respiratory droplets land somewhere. Wash your hands often and stop touching your face.",

Even when I go out now on the unavoidable trips, my patterns are definitely different. I go in and out as fast as possible, no leisurely shopping. This makes me feel that lifting the restrictions is hardly going to create an economic boom. Not only are there a lot of people like me (worried about getting exposed), but people obviously have less money now from having been furloughed. I guess the only other thing I'd do for feeling more safe is buy hand sanitizer when it becomes available, and a new mask if they ever become available.

Some of the items we buy just aren't popular enough to have been worth the space in their online ordering system. We also get our financial mail (bills and the like) at a PO box, which I've been picking up about every week and a half despite many fellow citizens being in there without masks. As far as the post office is concerned, I'm about to put in a forwarding order for our mail so I don't have to keep going there, but there's nothing I can do about the dog bones but go in, which I do because our poor, bored doggos appreciate them so much. lol",

I can see no logic in that, because they have to pay someone to handle and input our check, and if it were online it would all be handled by computers.) But the reason we have a PO box in the first place is because our mailbox is on a country street, not near neighbors, streetlights, etc. and we aren't always home when the postman comes. We long ago transferred anything we don't want to risk getting stolen to the PO box. What comes there are packages, magazines, a big, fat bundle from the accountant once a year that contains a tax organizer for us to fill out, old mail to my mother-in-law now deceased, letters from friends who I haven't heard from in a while, and other random stuff not online-able. lol",

You know you can talk to yourself while wearing that at the grocery and it is harder for other people to tell that you're the crazy one? Truth. I told my kids that I also sing out loud at the grocery along with the tunage they play and they tell me not to. Anyway, I don't use gloves to be honest because I see that as not beneficial for me.

There was a mortality rate of 8% for the group receiving Remdesivir versus 11.6% for the placebo group Gilead, the lab that developed Remdesivir, simply announced that in their own testing, 50% of people getting a five-day dose of Remdesivir saw improvement. Dr. Fauci compared this to when the first drugs were found to be helpful in the fight against AIDS. No one drug immediately solved the problem, but the first one that helped was encouraging. Who was really encouraged was the stock market! (And me, who had been thinking getting Covid-19 would doom me to having a stroke or heart damage or just be an automatic death sentence.) Anyway, the market bounded upward at the news, though Gilead's stock, while it did go up, didn't go as crazy as one might expect.

Anyway, everything said, do see if you can get tested for Covid-19, but try not to scare yourself to pieces. A lot of times, even people with positive test results are just sent home to take care of themselves there.",

A Charlie Rose interview of the Surgeon General of the US (Koop) in the early days of HiV said something similar to what Y Ben- Israel says. He said it would die out somehow just like all other epidemics, and Koop also said he had no idea why this would happen. Black Death died despite no germ theory until the late 19th century which he cited. Not that any of these diseases prove Covid will die out, but I provide the article purely for those who take an interest in it, especially since Georgia is planning to end lock down this week and Sweden didn't lock down.",

Those at higher risk are not a higher risk of getting the disease but are of higher risk of having a harder time of it if they do get it. But if you're taking chemo you're at higher risk on both counts, because chemo diminishes the strength of your immune system intentionally. Current treatments for cancer and for other diseases that are wholly or in part due to a problem with the immune system will often suppress the immune system response either intentionally or as a side effect. Those with weakened immune systems are more prone to getting anything, not just the corona virus. But you still would have to be exposed to it to get it. If you do get it, you are at a higher risk of getting it bad, but so are many people for reasons doctors can't figure out. What I've heard from experts, and I'm not one, is that some people who have slow growing cancers have been asked to delay cancer treatment but those with imminent problems have to do what they have to do. So while it is risky to continue chemo right now, it's also risky to have uncontrolled cancer. If this is the only mechanism you have, you do what you have to do and take extra precautions to avoid getting not only covid but any disease. As the above says, your oncologist is your guide here, he or she will know the best course. Worrying about it won't help any, so if you are able, try to just focus on things the way you did before covid just as you did with the flu and all the other diseases floating around out there, which you ignored because you need your focus to be on staying strong and getting through the cancer.

                    "Yes, there is a cytokine storm, I think they call it, but you're confusing getting the disease in the first place with having the disease.  A strong healthy immune system will protect you from getting it in the first place.  If you get it, it's not the strength of your immune system that is the problem, it's the nature of the virus hijacking your cells and getting into so many different systems in the body -- the liver, kidneys, lungs, and the blood clotting.  I've also been hearing from frontline docs that part of the problem was putting too many people on ventilators too soon.  It made it worse, they think.  So that also had something to do with the intense immune system reaction.  But again. having a healthy balanced immune system can help you not get sick in the first place, though of course it's not a guarantee and if an exposure is long enough and fierce enough it can be overwhelmed.  In short, two different problems.  One of the problems with our form of medicine is that it tries to kill everything that ails you rather than strengthen you so you can fight better naturally.  It's hard to know when the time to fight with toxic chemicals is the best way and when the best way is to fight with what nature gave us but making it work optimally by changing our lifestyle.  If you do choose to fight cancer with chemo, the chemo is intentionally toxic  because it has to be to kill off the cancer cells, but it's also toxic to everything else as well.  The hope is, and they're getting better at doing this in targeted ways, that when the cancer is gone the body will recover, but in the meantime you will have a suppressed immune system.  But also again, worrying about covid won't help, and the problem is there with all diseases out there, so docs manage you to keep you safe.  Do what you need to do and be well.",
                    "That's actually a great explanation paxiled.  Yes, that's why someone with a suppressed or compromised immune system is in danger initially.  They are more susceptible to issues of getting it and having no ability to fight it off can be deadly.  Then there is the \"over\" immune response that others suffer that is a totally separate thing. If someone has a compromised immune system such as someone doing chemo, they need to be extremely careful or as careful as they can be to avoid the virus."

They keep changing. At first it sounded like a mostly mild disease. Clearly, it's not. It's incredibly contagious. But still, for most people you're sick and then in a couple of weeks you're better, but for too many it takes a sharp and unpredictable change for the worse. I wore a mask for the first time at the store on Saturday. I didn't like it. But I'm 67 and my wife is 64, so although we don't have the conditions that make it the worst, we are old. My brother and sister in law both have conditions that make it the worst. So I've evolved to the point where, it's a new disease, and yes, the flu kills more people and so do auto accidents and smoking but this is brand new so we don't have to let it get to that point. We don't know if it's going to keep coming back like the flu yet. It doesn't mutate a lot like the flu, so far. So I now believe that we all have to be locked down or everyone has to open up and just accept getting it. The latter might end up conferring herd immunity quickly rather than the very slow approach we're taking. That means old folks like me dying. It also means a fair number of young folks dying. It means a culling of the herd so others can go back to making money faster. And I'd also maintain that, although politics is frowned on here, it really shouldn't be if it's the reason we're in this pickle, or the reason Italy is in its pickle, or the reason Brazil is in its pickle or the reason China let it get out of control in the first place.

Lack of financial resources can create a whole cascade of problems. And the future? I'm worried about that too. But I do think we will have to learn to live with this virus in our community. It's not going away and being locked down is just not sustainable. I will be very careful myself until there is a vaccine and probably even after that.

More about therapeutic options and more about vaccines and more about how to avoid getting this. What can you do to survive being social distanced for the long haul. So, that's a good question.

There is an organizational system for time in which you work for 25 straight minutes, and I mean power work. And then you take 5 minutes for a break. Then back to work for 25 minutes. If you block out a period of time to do this, it's amazing what you accomplish. I'm a big believer in exercise on a regular basis too. This doesn't have to be anything crazy. Youtube has lots of videos at different levels and all sorts of things. I am liking these things called HIIT which is done in like 20 minutes. You can be a true beginner and find things if you don't exercise but physical activity releases hormones in your body that are natural 'happy' hormones. :>) Make sure your doctor thinks you are up to exercising though, don't want to tell you to do something you can't do. There are apps that are helpful too for breathing and meditation. Calm and Headspace are two good ones. Online communication like right here is helpful for connection too.

My understanding is that \"flattening the curve\" is primarily aimed at taking the pressure off the health care system.

Maybe a vaccine or antiviral drug will cut deaths further, but failing this we will all get the virus at some point in the future, or at least the 70% of us needed to attain herd protection.

Very very low percentages of people are getting tested, especially in the US. China didn't test as much as you'd think either, they went mainly by symptoms because they were so overwhelmed. What will probably happen over time is, the disease will calm down thanks to social distancing, fewer people will have it, and scientists will be able to then do controlled studies to answer these kinds of questions.

As we've BEEN social distancing, and say we're going BACK to social distancing should cases increase, wouldn't that make herd immunity take a LOT longer to build up? Shouldn't we just bite the bullet, remember how small a percentage actually die from the disease (the reason the UK Govt.

A lot of deaths all crowded into a relatively short time, from a source that wasn't there before and so are new amounts added to the usual numbers of deaths in a year, would stress a lot of systems or even cause them to fail. (I think that at the present projected 1% estimated rate it would be around 3 million dead in the US and 600,000 dead in Britain, but even if it was a tenth of that, at .1%, it would be 300,000 dead in the US and 60,000 in Britain.) The medical and public-welfare systems would also have to take care of many more who were sick and needing care. My guess is that those making the decision were concerned not just for humanitarian reasons, but also because the hospitals would be overwhelmed (like they were in northern Italy) or even that the carrying capacity of society (food supplies, etc.) might become overwhelmed if the projected deaths were not spread out in some way.",

I don't think they had a big problem at any rate, but the answer is probably, yes, theoretically if herd immunity is actually possible with covid, and we don't actually know yet much about whether or not having had this disease confers immunity, there's mixed theories on this and apparently many people who have already been infected more than once, though not most by any means, so keep in mind that immunity of any kind is still a theory, not a fact. But the cost will be millions dead. Do you want that? Also keep in mind, this virus is much like the common cold and we've never developed immunity to that. We've never acquired immunity to the flu. Immunity isn't a guarantee. As to bats, the reason they live with so many viruses is a very very strong immune system against them, it has nothing to do with social distancing. On the other hand, there's a mold I believe that is rendering bats endangered, so that immunity to viruses isn't an immunity to everything. One has to understand, when any species becomes too numerous for the planet to maintain, this kind of thing happens. We have been able as humans to fight it because of our development of a cerebrum, but that hasn't stopped diseases and our own violence from culling the herd. Right now we're killing off the favorable climate that allows us to exist in such large numbers, so again, if we don't react it's very likely that will lead to an even larger culling. Everything dies, and death makes life possible. None of us wants to volunteer to die for this so nature comes up with something and then we try to outwit it. We could fix it, perhaps, with birth control but that concept came pretty late in the human population explosion.

Instead of the half hour it takes to wash and blow-dry, putting it into an elastic band takes two minutes.

If you're asking about something that happened a month or more ago, it's hard to assess what 'should' have happened without falling victim to 20/20 hindsight because of how much more we know now than we did even that recently.

The government response was sluggish, and while I'm sure the nursing home followed the rules they use for flu or legionella, the lockdown was not as immediate or severe as it would be if this happened now. For example, the nursing home would call the fire department for an EMT emergency, and who knows if the fire department was aware what they were dealing with and everyone masked up and so forth, and for a while the nursing home was still transferring patients in and out, and for a short while family members were still allowed to visit. This did get locked down quite fast, but I remember that the news reports at that time were that it was very confusing. If the case you are asking about was from back then, you'd have to judge it with a different level of expectation that they knew what they were doing, than if you are asking about something that happened in the past month.",
                    "Would that this were true.   Meatpacking plants in 3 states have recently made the news for outbreaks, and the companies did not do this.  The nursing home in Seattle was a tragic story but again those making the decisions in that home did not react.  Again, we have known since China after long delay announced this virus what to do with someone who showed symptoms of this virus and especially someone who tested positive for it, which we have known since December of last year.  Yet no other country other than South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong reacted immediately.  Japan did okay but delayed some.  Singapore and Hong Kong both let down their restrictions when the virus dimmed and it came back, and it's also coming back in China as it eases its restrictions.  They are blaming it on those who were abroad who are being allowed now to come back, but who knows?  This virus has by doctor's reports been in the US since just before Thanksgiving, and was probably in China before that.  Doctors then were assuming the unusual symptoms were just unusual reactions to the flu or a cold, because they had no idea a new virus was about. It took China a while to officially report it, but we all found out when a Chinese physician went on social media and told the world what was going on.  He was rewarded by being arrested and he died from the virus.  So we've know this existed for a long time.  China published the genome of it a long time ago.  Italy ignored it, we ignored it. much of the world is still ignoring it.  Politics is involved, but we won't go into that, but if you look at who has had the best responses so far they are efficiently governed countries like Germany.  Ideologically governed countries haven't done so well.  So I still say, the above posits not only someone with the virus but someone who tested positive and that is an easy answer since December in China -- quarantine, and contact trace.",

He left the groceries on the front porch and I retrieved them. After unpacking everything and washing up; maybe about an hour or so after, we were fitting all the grocery packaging and grocery bags into one big trash bag to be disregarded and put out of sight. As I was stuffing the last small bag (containing other items) into the larger one, the lack of room and my attempting to stuff everything to create room resulted in a plume of air pushing out from the garbage directly onto my face (was not wearing a mask at this point). I'm now wondering whether if there was contamination on the items that were in the bag, if the forcing of air out of the bag could in a sense pull the virus off the surface of the items and in into the escaping air, hypothetically resulting in an aerosolized issue for my face. It wasn't like I was breathed on from another person, but could it be possible that, hypothetically, the virus could have been released from the surfaces of the thrown away packaging by way of the air plume? I know there are a lot of unknowns right now and I had read about aerosol issues, so hoping this realistically wouldn't be one as I am definitely in a hot spot now. Thanks.",

If there had been sneeze droplets on the packaging, by the time it was in your trash it would be too late for any virus to be viable. And aerosolized virus doesn't come from pushing on packaging and having a rush of air in your face, it happens only in special circumstances (can happen when someone is in the hospital and being intubated, for example). From what I've read, even forceful sneezing doesn't have enough force to aerosolize the virus. (You could google how long the virus can live on packaging and how infectious it is after it's been sitting on paper or cardboard. But even when they find the virus when they look on surfaces, it's questionable how long it remains viable.) The virus is so new that there are just a lot of unknowns. Other countries' experiences suggest that while Covid-19 is contagious, it is not like the most contagious illnesses (measles, for example, can spread like wildfire among people who have no protection). So, wash your hands and stay 6 feet away from others like they say, but try not to be so worried that you stress over every little thing.",

If you want to do it before you have an infection, good idea.\" Here's his simple, three-step technique. 1. Take five deep breaths in, each time holding the breath for five seconds. 2. On the sixth deep breath, take it in and do a big cough (cover your mouth, of course). 3. Do two cycles of the above and the lay flat on your front (on a bed, ideally) taking slightly deeper \"normal\" breaths for the next 10 minutes. \"You've got to understand the majority of your lung is on your back not on your front,\" he adds. \"So by laying on your back your closing off more of the smaller airways and this is not good during the period of infection.\"",

This is apparently especially prevalent at drive through testing sites, especially ones where the person getting tested is told to do the swab themselves but can also happen when the person doing the testing has to reach through a car window. The problem is that the swab has to go pretty far up into the area to get a good sample. So that's one problem. But we also have to consider that there are a lot of false positives and false negatives in lots of diagnostic testing, most people just aren't paying as much attention as they are to this particular disease because it's all we're hearing about and it's so affected all of our lives even if we don't have the disease. For example, there's a colon cancer test you see advertised on TV that has about 10-20% false positives. The whole purpose of developing the test was for those who were too scared to get a colonoscopy, but this test pretty much guarantees that a lot of unnecessary colonoscopies will be done because if you test positive that's the next step. While false negatives are definitely bad, false positives are also bad, because they result in unnecessary treatments. Medicine is much less accurate than most of us believe it is so it shouldn't come as that big a surprise that this disease with all the urgency we're all putting into it would suffer from the same problems.",

                    "Earthie, while I agree that it's a good idea to wash all incoming items, I would say this should be the case whether they come from overseas or the United States. The constant drumbeat for any manufacturer is to put out a product less expensively than the competition. That does mean some items are produced in other countries, because US manufacturers find they have to send the work offshore to stay in business, because of labor costs. Possibly in a hundred years, labor will cost the same all over the world, but not yet. But even if an item is made in the United States, I would still always wash it, because even manufacturers in this country aren't going to be competitive if they don't produce their products as cheaply as possible. That means they can't afford a lot of niceties. A friend of mine worked in North Carolina in a chicken-packing plant. The place did what it had to by law, but did nothing in terms of good bathrooms for the workers where you could wash your hands, not locking the emergency doors (they would lock them in so people couldn't sneak out early) and stuff like that. It wasn't a pleasant place to work, and this was in the US. Chide all you want about places not being clean and safe, just don't kid yourself that this only happens when things come in from overseas. It happens anywhere lots of competition crunches companies into just doing the bare minimum."

They do have a pretty good chart out right now of how to tell symptoms apart. One thing that I have noticed on all of the charts is that runny noses, stuffed noses, etc. are more indicative of a cold. There are upper respiratory infections and lower respiratory infections. Colds are upper and Corona virus is lower. The hallmarks of the corona virus are dry cough, fever and shortness of breath. I do read a lot that people also may start with a sore throat. But sneezing and a lot of nose activity is more of a cold symptom. Regardless, your symptoms would be mild if you have the virus and we are all supposed to act like we have it and stay away from others. So, do that if you can. :>) Here's that chart on symptoms. https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2020/03/coronavirus-covid-19-identifying-the-symptoms.pdf",

So, I understand what you are saying. However, here is the good news. Your mom works in health care/ care home. Is this like a nursing home? If so, I would imagine they are taking her temperature before she enters. They are worried about what is brought INTO those patients as they are more vulnerable. So, they are monitoring her. Since she has COPD, that's a respiratory disorder that may make her more vulnerable and how old is she? If she is at higher risk, perhaps a leave of absence would be best or make sure she is doing everything possible to protect herself. Blood shot eyes on their own don't mean much of anything related this. If she shows any symptoms at all, the rule where I live is to assume you have it and isolate. The hallmark signs are cough, fever and possibly shortness of breath. I would avoid going to the doctor if you can help it for anything right now until this eases up as you know . . . that's where all the sick people are going. So, it's going to be a risky endeavor.

On another note, I also read that men seem to be more susceptible to getting, and dying from, the virus than women, but they don't know exactly why yet. There may be several reasons, including lifestyles, hormones, etc. \"Previous research, including by Klein, has revealed that men have lower innate antiviral immune responses to a range of infections including hepatitis C and HIV. Studies in mice suggest that this may also be true for coronaviruses, though Covid-19 specifically has not been studied. “Their immune system may not initiate an appropriate response when it initially sees the virus,” Klein said. Hormones can also play a role – oestrogen has been shown to increase antiviral responses of immune cells. And many genes that regulate the immune system are encoded on the X chromosome (of which men have one, and women have two) and so it is possible that some genes involved in the immune response are more active in women than in men. Sex differences in the immune response to Covid-19 are likely to show up in antibody surveys that are currently under way across the world. Klein said she has already reviewed papers on this from Chinese teams, who have tracked blood samples from patients over the course of infection. “We can expect more on this soon,” she said. Ultimately, Hawkes said, biology, lifestyle and behaviour are all likely to play a role.\" https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/men-are-much-more-likely-to-die-from-coronavirus-but-why I think they're going to be learning a lot about this virus for a long time.

Some research was done by a nutritionist, but it was picked up and run away with in a bestselling book by a naturopath who made a fortune selling all kinds of things based on your blood type. The argument was that blood type in part determined what foods you could digest and which your body might fight as invaders, and was extended to all manner of things we do and consume. It became such a craze we were selling kits by the tons so people could check their blood types, as at least back then doctors didn't order this as part of the blood tests they request. I assume this fad disappeared because I don't see any products in health food stores now sold by your blood type. But I wouldn't take this too seriously, because the vast majority of humans are type O, the universal donor. AB is fairly rare.

The types of sugars on cells are determined by a person’s genetic makeup including their blood type. Foster explained in The Conversation how a person’s blood type is determined by genes which, in turn, determine the kind of molecules that are present on the surface of a person’s red blood cells. Research into the Norovirus, a virus that causes severe vomiting and diarrhea, has shown that people with blood type B are less likely to be infected by the virus because of the sugars present on the cells of a person with that blood type. Petri went on to explain that “If you are blood group A, you have an extra sugar on the surface of your cells called anacitosal glucosamine, which you don’t have if you are blood group O.” That came from the following link which has considerable information about the study and other doctor's views.

There will be many fatalities but if you are careful to not touch your face, plus if no one coughs on you then you will likely also be enjoying a brighter day in future. Try to become ambidextrous so you touch doors, elevator buttons etc with your left because that way your right hand will not be infectious when you inevitably touch your face by accident. You still have to keep washing and sanitizing your right because sometimes you will touch something else with your right, but learning to become ambi for every movement except head touching requires concentration so it will be mentally challenging which might help break the anxiety focus.

So I have to go in next week and I hope I don't get it from someone at the pharmacy. I have written twice to the doctor. We are in shutdown in California, and so we are not working and so the threat is getting high here. I listened to a Kaiser Permanente healthcare lecture on Corona virus and the expert said that it is going up 2.5 times every 5 days here. So that means if we have 100 infections today 5 days will be 250, 5 days more 625, 5 more days 1563 etc. Until we stay in long enough to \"flatten the curve\".

We don't have enough hospital beds here for the ill so they are converting the hotels and other places into makeshift hospitals. We are trying to delay the spread of it to health care workers and to ourselves until we get a treatment.

I had a chest X-ray twice now and they said it was all normal. I had a pft test a breathing test and it suggested I had mild copd. but the doctor said that he thinks I'm just out of shape and a smoker and he thinks if I quit and started exercising and eating better that my test would be different. but the test said I had very mild copd . so if I have mild copd does this mean I'm going to die soon?? and with this corona virus if I catch it will I die cuz I have mild copd.. and can anxiety cause breathing problems every single day cuz now I focus on my breathing so much that I am short of breath alllllll day long but my symptoms are just like copd and empozema I'm freaking out I'm convinced that I'm dying and any day now I will be hospitalized I am 30 years old I have two kids and I'm freaking out so much I can't focus and I also am convinced I have colon cancer to I'm always constipated and I have acid reflux everyday . but the major thing is this lung thing I cough up phlegm every single day now for 7 months it won't go away I'm short of breath allll day long I can't even finish sentences without taking deep breath is its all I think about please help me please",

Combined with the extreme pollution we face in our water, air and food from our industrial society, while it's unusual to get this from smoking so young I'd consider myself lucky. My Dad spent the last ten years of his life unable to walk more than a block. My Mom died of cancer at age 55. My sister died of a blood clot at age 48. All chain smokers, and my sister was also obese. So if you're overweight (you said out of shape), smoke that much starting at an age when your body hadn't fully developed yet, and you're already getting these kinds of problems, it's time to quit smoking now. Trust me, this isn't the way you want to go. It's long, slow and really painful. I don't mean to scare you, but there's so much you really can't control in life, such as Covid, but smoking you can. It's not easy, but you can. So if that's the cause, you can fix it. As for the copd, I'm not sure that the doctors really know you have that. If it's a mild case, I'm not sure how they would differentiate that from so many other things that could affect the lungs, such as allergies et. It could be food allergies or intolerances catching up to you as well, such as to dairy. But anything you get in that area combined with the smoking is more than you want to handle. My brother never smoked, but he got ashthma because of our parents' smoking and now that he's over 70 he has copd. I've had allergies all my life, and learned they were caused by my parents' smoking when I moved out of the house at age 17 and a lot of my problems stopped, but not all of them.

On top of that, by itself getting CoViD can make anybody's heart muscle perform less well; and so that also causes a reduced blood flow going out. Your total reduction of outgoing blood flow can therefore be greater than if you didn't have the valve problem. Let's see what the American cardiologist group says about ordinary flu: \"Acute viral infections have three categories of short-term effects on the cardiovascular system: ... Second, myocardial depression leading to heart failure. ...\" from https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2020/03/01/08/42/feature-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-provides-potent-reminder-of-the-risk-of-infectious-agents \"Myocardial depression\" means the heart muscle isn't working so good. In sepsis from the CoV infection, the flood of inflammatory chemicals are involved in that. \"Heart failure\" means not pumping out enough blood. But the \"failure\" presumably can be temporary if heart muscle is not permanently damaged. However, the effect can still be devastating in the short term. None of that, though, tells you HOW MUCH greater risk there is for you.",

I would have to *guess* that the rate for people with only a mild-moderate valve problem would be much lower than those with a lot of atherosclerosis. For those without other health problems (aka comorbidities), the fatality rate is 2.3%. Let's say as a wild guess that your rate is double that. It's still only 4.6%, not at a terrifying 90%. Still, you should take extra care, of course. Btw, do you wear a bracelet that alerts docs to your condition?",

But that's why he said being strict about social distancing and self-isolation is so important.\" I presume what he means is if someone coughs the droplets can only infect a surface that is 6 feet away (including your face and air passageway) that you might touch later and end up infected. So inhaling them within 6 feet of the cougher can infect you, otherwise you are safe if farther away. Or does someone else know the answer? If so a direct quote and a link would be appreciated.",

At first I thought it was something I ate, then I thought it was my medication no working due (I am a chronic hepatitis B patient) because when I was dealing with that virus when it became active, it was similar symptoms. Lack of appetite, odd fatigue & weird sleep patterns, weight loss and muscle wasting, diarrhea, etc. Anyway, I was going on for a month like this and that is how I felt, that some virus was attacking my system. It eventually slowed down to almost nothing today and this past week, and everything is sort of going back to normal (I do have a cough that has been around for a week, and a stuffed up nose, but these too are subsiding). Anyway, I wanted to share this because all tests I took, nothing was able to be found with me. And it seems like this may be what I had... though doctor refused to give me a test because I was not presenting with chills & fever.

As the world watches COVID-19 take hold in our communities, there’s one trend that has caught the curiosity of researchers: why are kids not responding the same way to the virus as adults? While it was originally believed that children were immune to the virus, there are now cases involving children — at least one in Alberta, and 17 in Ontario, including one involving a baby boy. Dawn Bowdish, the Canada Research Chair in Aging and Immunity, says that we now know children are infected at the same rate as adults, but that they don’t necessarily show the symptoms. “When they do show the symptoms, they’re very mild compared to adult symptoms,” she says. “This shows us that the virus can get into kids’ bodies, they just don’t get very sick.” Older adults and those with pre-existing health conditions seem to be the most at risk compared to children. One study in JAMA found that reported cases in children were ‘rare’ as the average age for coronavirus patients was between 49 to 56 years old. Another study from the New England Journal of Medicine examined 425 patients, finding that no one under the age of 15 had the virus. The WHO has reported that 2.4 per cent of cases were children under the age of 18, while only 0.2 per cent of cases were cases where children were seriously ill. “We don’t have to worry about our children dying,” says Bowdish. However, she acknowledges that the virus’ death rates vary from country to country, and vulnerable populations are the most at risk everywhere, including in Canada. “Right now, children aren’t going to be the ones filling up our emergency rooms, it’s going to be older adults.” she says. Of course, if you suspect your child is sick, it’s a good idea to get them tested just in case. Currently, health experts don’t understand whether children can transmit the virus in the same way that they can transmit influenza in a community outbreak — meaning spreading it to parents, grandparents, classmates, etc. In influenza outbreaks, taking measures such as shutting down schools or vaccinating against the illness can break the transmission of the virus, benefitting the whole community. In the case of COVID-19, we just don’t know the role that kids play in its spread. Health experts don’t understand whether children can transmit the virus the same way they can transmit influenza With March Break approaching Bowdish says it could cause the infection to spread, as many families head out on vacation to the U.S. and international destinations. The Ontario government recently announced the closure of all publicly funded schools in Ontario for two weeks following March break, in response to the growing number of cases of COVID-19. It’s a move that she says is “excellent.” “Families [who may get infected] will come back from their March Break holiday and have two weeks before the kids end up back at school. Hopefully, that will be sufficient to slow down transmission,” she says. Bowdish adds that the earlier we take these measures to reduce the spread of infection before the health care system is overburdened, the better chance it has to help. While closing the schools will definitely help to prevention infection, Bowdish says there is another way — one that is harder than the other. Staying away from grandparents. “Grandparents are everyone’s defacto babysitter,” she says. “This is problematic because this virus infects older adults and causes them to become severely ill.” She suggests that parents find alternative childcare if they can. Another prevention strategy is teaching children how to properly wash their hands. Not only does educating kids on how they can protect themselves empower them and make them feel like they have a little bit of control in such an uncertain time, it also teaches them that they also have a role to play in keeping other people safe. Families [who may get infected] will come back from their March Break holiday and have two weeks before the kids end up back at school. Hopefully, that will slow down transmission Bowdish says these measures are important, as they help adults and children take care of themselves. While the virus may seem like a regular flu, it’s important for parents, and children to step up and take precautions whenever they can. “Anytime we have a bad flu year or an epidemic, [these] cause mortality and our hospitals become strained,” she says. “That’s one of the consequences we’re going to see here. We need to break the transmission of the virus.”",

Well, to run around on their own, yes. But not to play on the equipment or interact with others. The virus can survive on metal, glass and other surfaces you may find at the park playground. Can you make your own hand sanitizer for your kids? This article says you can try but to get enough alcohol is hard as it has to be at least 60%. If your kiddo is sick, as many would be at this time of year regardless of corona, do you take them to the doctor? Avoid it if at all possible. If they have trouble breathing at all or can't drink, then yes, get help right away. While kids are out of school, if old enough, get them in on the laundry business and have them wash their sheets and bedding more often. Call Grandma rather than visit her.",
